# DIABETES IN PREGNANCY

The prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy has been increasing in the U.S. in parallel with the worldwide epidemic of obesity. Not only is the prevalence of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes increasing in individuals of reproductive age but there is also a dramatic increase in the reported rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Diabetes confers significantly greater maternal and fetal risk that is largely related to the degree of hyperglycemia but also is related to chronic complications and comorbidities of diabetes. In general, specific risks of diabetes in pregnancy include spontaneous abortion, fetal anomalies, preeclampsia, fetal demise, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, exposure to hyperglycemia in utero increases the risks of obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes in offspring later in life (1,2).

# Preconception Counseling

# Recommendations

15.1 Starting at puberty and continuing in all people with diabetes and childbearing potential, preconception counseling should be incorporated into routine diabetes care.

15.2 Family planning should be discussed, and effective contraception (with consideration of long-acting, reversible contraception) should be prescribed and used until an individual’s treatment plan and A1C are optimized for pregnancy.

15.3 Preconception counseling should address the importance of achieving glucose levels as close to normal as is safely possible, ideally A1C < 6.5% (<48 mmol/mol), to reduce the risk of congenital anomalies, preeclampsia, macrosomia, preterm birth, and other complications.

# Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy

# 15.4

Individuals with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) should seek preconception screening for diabetes and preconception care to identify and treat hyperglycemia and prevent congenital malformations. E is associated with the lowest risk of congenital anomalies (given that organogenesis occurs primarily at 5–8 weeks of gestation), preeclampsia, and preterm birth (12–16). In a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, preconception care for pregnant individuals with preexisting diabetes was associated with lower A1C and reduced risks of birth defects, preterm delivery, perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational-age births, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (17).

To minimize the occurrence of complications, beginning at the onset of puberty or at diagnosis, all adults and adolescents with diabetes of childbearing potential should receive education about 1) the risks of malformations associated with unplanned pregnancies, even with mild hyperglycemia, and 2) the use of effective contraception at all times when trying to prevent a pregnancy. Preconception counseling using developmentally appropriate educational tools enables adolescents with childbearing potential to make well-informed decisions (4). Preconception counseling resources tailored to adolescents are available at no cost through the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (18).

# Preconception Care Recommendations

# 15.5

Individuals with preexisting diabetes who are planning a pregnancy should ideally begin receiving interprofessional care for preconception, which includes an endocrinology health care professional, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, registered dietitian nutritionist, and diabetes care and education specialist, when available. B

# 15.6

In addition to focused attention on achieving glycemic goals, a standard preconception care should be augmented with extra focus on nutrition, physical activity, diabetes self-care education, and screening for diabetes comorbidities and complications. B

# 15.7

Individuals with preexisting diabetes who are planning a pregnancy or who have become pregnant should be counseled on the risk of development and/or progression of diabetic retinopathy. Dilated eye examinations should occur ideally before pregnancy as well as in the first trimester, and then pregnant individuals should be monitored every trimester and for 1 year postpartum as indicated by the degree of retinopathy and as recommended by the eye care health care professional. B

All individuals with diabetes and childbearing potential should be informed about the importance of achieving and maintaining as near euglycemia as safely possible prior to conception and throughout pregnancy. Observational studies show an increased risk of diabetic embryopathy, especially anencephaly, microcephaly, congenital heart disease, kidney anomalies, and caudal regression, directly proportional to elevations in A1C during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy (12). Although observational studies are confounded by the association between elevated periconceptional A1C and other engagement in self-care behaviors, the quantity and consistency of data are convincing and support the recommendation to optimize glycemia prior to conception with an A1C <6.5% (<48 mmol/mol), as this is associated with a lower risk of GDM recurrence.

Preconception evaluation should assess maternal weight. In a randomized trial of individuals with overweight or obesity and a history of GDM, weight loss prior to a subsequent pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of GDM recurrence. The importance of preconception care for all pregnant people is highlighted by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee Opinion 762, “Prepregnancy Counseling” (5).

Prescription of prenatal vitamins with at least 400–800 mg of folic acid (20) and 150 mg of potassium iodide (21) is recommended prior to conception. Review and counseling on abstaining from nicotine products, alcohol, and recreational drugs, including marijuana, is important.

## Table 15.2—Blood glucose goals in pregnancies associated with diabetes

| Glucose measurement | Type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes^ | GDM treated with insulin | GDM not treated with insulin |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Fasting glucose | 70–95 mg/dL (3.9–5.3 mmol/L) | 70–95 mg/dL (3.9–5.3 mmol/L) | <95 mg/dL (<5.3 mmol/L) |
| 1-h postprandial glucose | 110–140 mg/dL* (6.1–7.8 mmol/L) | 110–140 mg/dL* (6.1–7.8 mmol/L) | <140 mg/dL* (<7.8 mmol/L) |
| 2-h postprandial glucose | 100–120 mg/dL (5.6–6.7 mmol/L) | 100–120 mg/dL (5.6–6.7 mmol/L) | <120 mg/dL (<6.7 mmol/L) |

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) blood glucose goals shown are recommended by the Fifth International Workshop-Conference on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (42). ^Lower glucose limits do not apply to individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with nutrition alone. Aim for less stringent goals if these cannot be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, based on clinical experience and individualization of care. *Optimal goal includes either a 1-h postprandial glucose level or 2-h postprandial glucose level within column of type of diabetes.

<7% (<53 mmol/mol). Due to physiological increases in red blood cell turnover, A1C levels fall during normal pregnancy (45,46). Additionally, as A1C represents an integrated measure of glucose, it may not fully capture postprandial hyperglycemia, which drives macrosomia. Thus, although A1C may be useful, it should be used as a secondary measure of glycemic outcomes in pregnancy, after blood glucose monitoring.

In the second and third trimesters, A1C <6% (<42 mmol/mol) has the lowest risk of large-for-gestational-age infants (44,47,48), preterm delivery (49), and preeclampsia (1,50). Taking all of this into account, a goal of <6% (<42 mmol/mol) is optimal during pregnancy if it can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, which, in addition to the usual adverse sequelae, may increase the risk of low birth weight (51,52). Given the alteration in red blood cell kinetics during pregnancy and physiological changes in glycemic parameters, A1C levels may need to be monitored more frequently than usual (e.g., monthly).

## Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Pregnancy

The Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Pregnant Women With Type 1 Diabetes Trial (CONCEPTT) was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in addition to standard care, including optimization of pre- and postprandial glucose goals versus standard care for pregnant people with type 1 diabetes. It demonstrated the value of using real-time CGM in pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes by showing a mild improvement in A1C and significant improvements in the maternal glucose time in range (TIR) and time above range (TAR), without an increase in hypoglycemia, and reductions in large-for-gestational-age births, length of infant hospital stays, and severe neonatal hypoglycemia (53). An observational cohort study that evaluated the glycemic variables reported using CGM systems found that lower mean glucose, lower SD, and higher percentage of TIR were associated with lower risks of large-for-gestational-age births and other adverse neonatal outcomes (54). Data from one study suggest that the use of the CGM-reported mean glucose is superior to the use of estimated A1C, glucose management indicator, and other calculations to estimate A1C, given the changes to A1C that occur in pregnancy (55). One RCT and two observational studies have found that a 5% increase in CGM TIR was associated with improvements in neonatal morbidity, including large-for-gestational-age births and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (53,54,56). CGM TIR can be used for assessment of glycemic outcomes in people with type 1 diabetes, but it does not provide actionable data to address fasting and postprandial hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The cost of CGM use by pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes is offset by improved maternal and neonatal outcomes (57).

There are insufficient data to support the use of CGM in all people with type 2 diabetes or GDM (58,59). The decision of whether to use CGM in pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes or GDM should be individualized based on treatment plan, circumstances, preferences, and needs.

The international consensus on TIR (41) endorses pregnancy glucose goal ranges and goals for TIR for people with type 1 diabetes using CGM as reported on the ambulatory glucose profile. The international consensus on TIR (41) endorses the same sensor glucose goal ranges for individuals with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy and GDM but could not quantify the goal of amount of time spent within each category because of insufficient data. However, the consensus does not specify the type or accuracy of the CGM device or need for alarms and alerts. A small prospective, observational study of pregnant people with type 1 diabetes simultaneously monitored with intermittently scanning CGM (isCGM) and real-time CGM for 7 days in early pregnancy demonstrated a higher percentage of time below range (TBR) in the isCGM group. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia measured by isCGM should therefore not necessarily lead to a reduction of insulin dose and/or increased carbohydrate intake at bedtime unless these episodes are confirmed by blood glucose meter measurements (60). Selection of CGM device should be based on an individual's circumstances, preferences, and needs.

Goals for sensor glucose ranges in pregnancy:

- Goal sensor glucose range 63–140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/L): TIR, goal >70%
- TBR (<63 mg/dL [<3.5 mmol/L]): level 1 TBR, goal <4%
- TBR (<54 mg/dL [<3.0 mmol/L]): level 2 TBR, goal <1%
- TAR (>140 mg/dL [>7.8 mmol/L]): TAR, goal <25%

Goals for time spent in each range are specific for pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes.

# Medical Nutrition Therapy

In people with preexisting diabetes, glycemic goals are usually achieved through a combination of insulin administration and medical nutrition therapy. Because glycemic goals in pregnant individuals are stricter than in nonpregnant individuals, it is important that pregnant people with diabetes eat consistent amounts of carbohydrates to match their insulin dosage and to avoid hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Referral to an RDN is important to establish a food plan and insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio and determine weight gain goals. The quality of the carbohydrates should be evaluated. A subgroup analysis of the CONCEPTT study demonstrated that the diets of individuals planning pregnancy and currently pregnant assessed during the run-in phase prior to randomization were characterized by high-fat, low-fiber, and poor-quality carbohydrate intakes. Fruit and vegetable consumption was inadequate, with one in four participants at risk for micronutrient deficiencies, highlighting the importance of medical nutrition therapy. The food plan should provide adequate calorie intake to promote fetal, neonatal, and maternal health, achieve glycemic goals, and promote appropriate weight gain, according to the 2009 National Academy of Medicine recommendations. There is no definitive research that identifies a specific optimal calorie intake for people with GDM or suggests that their calorie needs are different from those of pregnant individuals without GDM. The food plan should be based on a nutrition assessment with dietary reference intake guidance from the National Academy of Medicine.

# Lifestyle and Behavioral Management

Although there is some heterogeneity, many RCTs and a Cochrane review suggest that the risk of GDM may be reduced by diet, exercise, and lifestyle counseling, particularly when interventions are started during the first trimester or early in the second trimester. After diagnosis of GDM, treatment starts with medical nutrition therapy, physical activity, and weight management, depending on pregestational weight, as outlined in this section. Depending on the population, studies suggest that 70–85% of people diagnosed with GDM under Carpenter-Coustan criteria can manage GDM with lifestyle modification alone; it is anticipated that this proportion will be even higher if the lower International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups diagnostic thresholds are used.

# Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy

# Physical Activity

It is recommended that generally healthy people do at least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week during pregnancy and postpartum, preferably spread throughout the week (74). Adjustments to a physical activity routine or plan should be done in consultation with a health care professional, especially if someone is considering a big change in physical activity intensity (74). Such activity improves cardiorespiratory fitness and reduces the risk for excessive gestational weight gain or postpartum weight retention (74).

With respect to GDM, a systematic review demonstrated improvements in glucose outcomes and reductions in need to start insulin or insulin dose requirements with an exercise intervention. However, there was heterogeneity in the types of effective exercise (aerobic, resistance, or both) and duration of exercise (20–50 min/day, 2–7 days/week of moderate intensity) (75), so there is insufficient evidence about which specific type of exercise program has the biggest impact on these diabetes-related outcomes in pregnancy.

The insulin requirement levels off toward the end of the third trimester. A rapid and significant reduction in insulin requirements may indicate the development of placental insufficiency (36), although data are conflicting (77).

# Health Care Delivery for People With Diabetes in Pregnancy

As discussed in the preconception care subsection above, team-based care is recommended either through a single specialized center (when available) or multiple centers with interprofessional team members as part of the care plan during pregnancy. A meta-analysis of 32 RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions, which ranged from telemedicine visits to the use of health apps, used in combination with in-person visits for GDM demonstrated reduced incidences of cesarean delivery, premature rupture of membranes, pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia, preterm birth, neonatal asphyxia, and polyhydramnios compared with standard in-person care alone (76).

# Pharmacologic Therapy

# Insulin

Insulin should be used to manage type 1 diabetes in pregnancy and is preferred for the management of type 2 diabetes in pregnancy and GDM. The physiology of pregnancy necessitates frequent titration of insulin to match changing requirements and underscores the importance of daily and frequent blood glucose monitoring. In early pregnancy, many people with type 1 diabetes used either an AID system with glucose targets that could be set near or in the pregnancy-specific fasting glucose range or standard of care (CGM use with another insulin delivery strategy).

Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have been studied in pregnancy and postpartum. In one study, 124 pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes used an AID system set to a pump glucose target of 100 mg/dL or to standard of care. The 24-h TIR was similar between groups, but the nocturnal TIR was higher (6.58%, P = 0.003), the 24-h TBR was lower (1.34%, P = 0.002), and the nocturnal TBR was lower (1.86%, P = 0.0005) in the AID group (92).

of using assistive techniques with expert guidance (92–94). Assessments of potential candidates for AID wear in pregnancy should include relevant parameters such as glycemic levels, presence or absence of severe hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events, ability or comfort in engaging with diabetes technology, psychosocial determinants, cost, individual preference, and other factors as relevant.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion was compared with intravenous insulin infusion in an RCT of 70 participants during labor and delivery. There was no difference between groups in the primary outcome of neonatal hypoglycemia or in secondary outcomes (e.g., mean neonatal glucose in first 24 h of life, severe neonatal hypoglycemia) (95). In an RCT of 18 participants using AID or sensor-augmented pump therapy for 12 weeks postpartum (96), those in the AID group had fewer hypoglycemia episodes (96). See sensor-augmented pumps and automated insulin delivery systems in Section 7, “Diabetes Technology,” for more information on these systems.

# Metformin

Metformin was associated with a lower risk of neonatal hypoglycemia and less maternal weight gain than insulin in systematic reviews and RCTs for GDM treatment, but treatment monotherapy failure occurred in 14–46% of individuals (103,106–109). A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs demonstrated that metformin treatment in pregnancy does not reduce the risk of GDM in high-risk individuals with obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, or preexisting insulin resistance (110). RCTs of individuals with preexisting type 2 diabetes treated either with insulin alone or insulin plus metformin did not show differences in composite neonatal health outcomes between groups (111,112), and one of these also included individuals diagnosed with diabetes early in gestation (112). Neonatal birth weights were smaller in the metformin groups of these studies, but the metformin group experienced more drug intolerance in one study and there was a doubling of small-for-gestational-age neonates in the other (111,112).

# Special Considerations for Management of Pregnancies With Diabetes

Pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes have an increased risk of hypoglycemia in the first trimester and after delivery, and like all pregnant people, they have altered counterregulatory response in pregnancy that may decrease hypoglycemia awareness. Education for people with diabetes and family members about the prevention, recognition, and treatment of hypoglycemia is important before, during, and after pregnancy to help prevent and manage hypoglycemia risk.

Pregnancy is a ketogenic state, and people with type 1 diabetes and, to a lesser extent, those with type 2 diabetes are at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at lower blood glucose levels than in the nonpregnant state. Pregnant people with type 1 diabetes should be advised to obtain ketone test strips and receive education on DKA prevention and detection. DKA carries a high risk of stillbirth. Those in DKA who are unable to eat often require 10% dextrose with an insulin drip to adequately meet the higher carbohydrate demands of the placenta and fetus in the third trimester to resolve their ketosis.

Retinopathy is a special concern in pregnancy. The necessary rapid implementation of euglycemia in the setting of retinopathy.

is associated with worsening of retinopathy incidence of preeclampsia (135,136), although a meta-analysis showed that preeclampsia reductions occurred with aspirin administration in high-risk groups overall (128). Individuals with GDM may be candidates for aspirin therapy for preeclampsia prevention if they have a single high-risk factor, such as chronic hypertension or an autoimmune disease, or multiple moderate risk factors, such as being nulliparous, having obesity, being age ≥35 years, or other factors per the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (130). More studies are needed to assess the long-term effects of prenatal aspirin exposure on offspring (135).

Recommended weight gain during pregnancy for people with overweight status is 15–25 lbs (6.8–11.3 kg) and for those with obesity is 10–20 lbs (4.5–9.1 kg) (69). There are no adequate data on optimal weight gain versus weight maintenance in pregnant people with BMI >35 kg/m²; however, losing weight is not recommended because of the increased risk of small-for-gestational-age infants (26).

# PREECLAMPSIA AND ASPIRIN

# Recommendation

15.23 Pregnant individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes should be prescribed low-dose aspirin 100–150 mg/day starting at 12–16 weeks of gestation to lower the risk of preeclampsia. A dosage of 162 mg/day may be acceptable; currently, in the U.S., low-dose aspirin is available in 81-mg tablets.

Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia (128). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that blood pressure measurements be obtained throughout gestation to screen for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (129). The Task Force also recommends using low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) as a preventive medication at 12 weeks of gestation in individuals at high risk for preeclampsia, such as those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (130).

However, a meta-analysis and an additional trial demonstrate that low-dose aspirin <100 mg is not effective in reducing preeclampsia, so a dose of >100 mg is required (131–133). A cost-benefit analysis has concluded that this approach would reduce morbidity, save lives, and lower health care costs (134). There are insufficient data about whether the use of aspirin specifically in pregnant people with preexisting diabetes ultimately reduces the incidence of preeclampsia (135,136).

# Potentially Harmful Medications in Pregnancy

15.25a In pregnant individuals with diabetes and chronic hypertension, a blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mmHg for initiation or titration of therapy is associated with better pregnancy outcomes than reserving treatment for severe hypertension, with no increase in risk of small-for-gestational-age birth weight. There are limited data on the optimal lower limit, but therapy should be deintensified for blood pressure <90/60 mmHg. A blood pressure goal of 110–135/85 mmHg is suggested in the interest of reducing the risk for accelerated maternal hypertension (139–141).

15.25b In most circumstances, lipid-lowering medications should be stopped prior to conception and avoided in sexually active individuals of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception. During pregnancy, treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers is contraindicated because they may cause fetal renal dysplasia, oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and intrauterine growth restriction (30).

A large study found that after adjusting for confounders, first-trimester ACE inhibitor exposure does not appear to be associated with congenital malformations (142). ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be stopped prior to pregnancy or as soon as possible in the first trimester to avoid second- and third-trimester fetopathy (142).

Antihypertensive drugs known to be effective and safe in pregnancy include methyldopa, nifedipine.

# Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy

labetalol, and clonidine. Atenolol is not recommended, but other b-blockers may be used, if necessary. Diuretic use during pregnancy is generally not recommended, although it may be used safely when prescribed at lower doses for individuals in certain circumstances (e.g., chronic kidney disease and reduced glomerular filtration rate) (143).

For most individuals, lipid-lowering medications (e.g., bempedoic acid, PCSK9 therapies, fibrates) should be stopped prior to pregnancy or at the first pregnancy visit (31). Based on available evidence, statins should also be avoided in pregnancy in most circumstances (31). The risk of teratogenicity with statins appears to be low, but data are limited (31). Statins can be considered in a shared decision-making process between pregnant people with diabetes and their health care teams, including discussion of risks and benefits in pregnant individuals at high-risk, such as those with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or familial hypercholesterolemia (homozygous or severe heterozygous) (31). Hydrophilic statins, such as pravastatin, may be associated with less fetal harm than lipophilic statins (144). Pravastatin has been studied in multiple pregnancy trials administering therapy at various time points in gestation with the aim to reduce preeclampsia risk, and although its ability to do so is inconclusive to date, there does not appear to be increased neonatal mortality or morbidity associated with its use during gestation (31). See pregnancy and antihypertensive medications in Section 10, “Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management,” for more information on managing blood pressure in pregnancy.

# POSTPARTUM CARE

# Recommendations

15.26 Insulin requirements need to be evaluated and adjusted for individuals requiring insulin after delivery because insulin resistance decreases dramatically immediately postpartum.

15.27 A contraceptive plan should be discussed and implemented with all people with diabetes of childbearing potential.

15.28 Breastfeeding efforts are recommended for all individuals with diabetes. A Breastfeeding is recommended for individuals with a history of GDM for multiple benefits, A including a reduced risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. B

# Diabetes Treatment Postpartum

For individuals requiring insulin after delivery, insulin sensitivity increases dramatically with the delivery of the placenta. In one study, insulin requirements in the immediate postpartum period are roughly 34% lower than prepregnancy insulin requirements (145). Insulin sensitivity then returns to prepregnancy levels over the following 1–2 weeks. For individuals taking insulin, particular attention should be directed to hypoglycemia prevention in the setting of breastfeeding and erratic sleep and eating schedules (146). Individuals with GDM usually do not require diabetes medications in the postpartum period.

# Contraception

A major barrier to effective preconception care is the fact that the majority of pregnancies are unplanned. Planning pregnancy is critical in individuals with preexisting diabetes to achieve the optimal glycemic goals necessary to prevent congenital malformations and reduce the risk of other complications. Therefore, all individuals with diabetes of childbearing potential should have family planning options reviewed at regular intervals to make sure that effective contraception is implemented and maintained. This applies to individuals in the immediate postpartum period. Individuals with diabetes have the same contraception options and recommendations as those without diabetes, although the existence of diabetes complications or other vascular disease may modify recommended options. Long-acting, reversible contraception may be ideal for individuals with diabetes and childbearing potential. The risk of an unplanned pregnancy outweighs the risk of any currently available contraception option.

# Special Postpartum Considerations for Individuals With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus

Because GDM often represents previously undiagnosed prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, or even developing type 1 diabetes, individuals with GDM should be tested for persistent diabetes or prediabetes at 4–12 weeks postpartum with a fasting 75-g OGTT using nonpregnancy criteria as outlined in Section 2, “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes,” specifically Tables 2.1 and 2.2. The OGTT is recommended over A1C at 4–12 weeks postpartum, because A1C may be persistently impacted (lowered) by the increased.

Red blood cell turnover related to pregnancy, by blood loss at delivery, or by the preceding 3-month glucose profile. The OGTT is more sensitive at detecting glucose intolerance, including both prediabetes and diabetes, and has been examined as a screening tool for these conditions in the first 12 weeks after delivery in individuals who had a recent pregnancy with GDM. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, a positive screen for diabetes requires two abnormal values. If both the fasting plasma glucose ($126 mg/dL [$7.0 mmol/L]) and 2-h plasma glucose ($200 mg/dL [$11.1 mmol/L]) are abnormal in a single screening test, then the diagnosis of diabetes is made. If only one abnormal value in the OGTT meets diabetes criteria, the test should be repeated to confirm that the abnormality persists. OGTT testing immediately postpartum, while still hospitalized, has demonstrated improved engagement in testing but also variably reduced sensitivity to the diagnosis of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes.

Individuals with a history of GDM should have ongoing screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes every 1–3 years, even if results of the initial 75-g OGTT at 4–12 weeks postpartum are normal. Ongoing evaluation may be performed with any recommended glycemic test (e.g., annual A1C, annual fasting plasma glucose, or triennial 75-g OGTT using thresholds for nonpregnant individuals).

Individuals with a history of GDM have an increased lifetime maternal risk for diabetes estimated at 50–60%, and those with GDM have a 10-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with those without GDM. Absolute risk of developing type 2 diabetes after GDM increases linearly through a person’s lifetime, being 20% at 10 years, 30% at 20 years, 40% at 30 years, 50% at 40 years, and 60% at 50 years. Hazard ratios for incident diabetes were significantly elevated for a history of GDM in a single pregnancy but were even higher for a history of two GDM pregnancies in a large retrospective cohort study (hazard ratios ranged from 4.35- to 15.8-fold based on number of pregnancies with GDM and in which pregnancy the individual had GDM). In the prospective Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II), subsequent diabetes risk after a history of GDM was significantly lower in those who followed healthy eating patterns.
