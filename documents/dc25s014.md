# 14. Children and Adolescents

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” includes the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, an interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system for ADA’s clinical practice recommendations and a full list of Professional Practice Committee members, please refer to Introduction and Methodology. Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.

The management of diabetes in children and adolescents (individuals < 18 years of age) cannot simply be derived from care routinely provided to adults with diabetes. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, developmental considerations, and response to therapy in pediatric diabetes are often different from those of adult diabetes. There are also differences in recommended care for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and other forms of diabetes. This section is divided into two major parts: the first part addresses care for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, and the second part addresses care for children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. Monogenic diabetes (neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young) and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, which are often present in youth, are discussed in Section 2, “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes.” Table 14.1A and Table 14.1B provide an overview of the recommendations for screening and treatment of complications and related conditions in pediatric type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. In addition to comprehensive diabetes care, youth with diabetes should receive age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate pediatric care, including immunizations as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1). To ensure continuity of care as a person with diabetes becomes an adult, guidance is provided at the end of this section on the transition from pediatric to adult diabetes care.

Due to the nature of pediatric clinical research, the recommendations for children and adolescents with diabetes are less likely to be based on clinical trial evidence. However, expert opinion and a review of available and relevant experimental data are summarized in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) position statements “Type 1 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents” (2) and “Evaluation and Management of Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes” (3). Finally, other sections in the Standards of Care may have recommendations that apply to youth with diabetes and are referenced in the narrative of this section.

# Children and Adolescents

# Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

# TYPE 1 DIABETES

Type 1 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in youth (4), although there are more adults living with and diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (5). The health care professional must consider the unique aspects of care and management of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, such as changes in insulin sensitivity related to physical growth and sexual maturation, ability to provide self-care, supervision in the childcare and school environment, neurological vulnerability to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in young children, and possible adverse neurocognitive effects of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (6,7). Attention to family dynamics, developmental stages, and physiologic differences related to sexual maturity is essential in developing and implementing an optimal diabetes treatment plan (8). Additionally, more people (adults and youth) with type 1 diabetes are experiencing obesity than in the past, which adds to the complexity of living with and managing type 1 diabetes (9).

An interprofessional team trained in pediatric diabetes management and sensitive to the challenges of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their families should provide diabetes-specific care for this population. It is essential that diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES), medical nutrition therapy (MNT), and psychosocial and behavioral support be provided at diagnosis and routinely (e.g., at each follow-up visit) thereafter in a developmentally appropriate format that builds on prior knowledge by a team of health care professionals experienced with the biological, educational, nutritional, behavioral, and emotional needs of the growing child and family. The diabetes team, considering the youth’s developmental and psychosocial needs, should ask about and discuss diabetes management responsibilities with youth and parents or caregivers on an ongoing basis.

# Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support

# Recommendation

14.1 Youth with type 1 diabetes and their parents or caregivers (for individuals aged <18 years) should receive culturally sensitive and developmentally appropriate individualized diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) according to national standards at diagnosis and routinely thereafter. B

Self-management in pediatric diabetes involves both the youth and their parents or adult caregivers. No matter how sound the medical plan is, it will only be effective if the family and/or affected individuals can implement it. Family involvement is a vital component of optimal diabetes management throughout childhood and adolescence. As parents or caregivers are critical to diabetes self-management in youth, diabetes care requires an approach that places the youth and their parents or caregivers at the center of the care model.

The pediatric diabetes care team must be capable of evaluating the educational, behavioral, emotional, and psychosocial factors that impact treatment plan implementation and must work with the youth and family to overcome barriers or redefine goals as appropriate. As the youth grows, develops, and acquires the need and desire for greater independent self-care skills, DSMES requires periodic reassessment. The pediatric diabetes team should work with the youth and their parents or caregivers to ensure there is not a premature transfer of self-management tasks to the youth during this time. In addition, it is important to assess the educational needs and skills of, and provide training to, daycare workers, school nurses, and school personnel who are responsible for the care and supervision of the child with diabetes (2,10,11).

Although carbohydrate content is the primary variable for calculation of mealtime insulin doses, meals with higher fat and protein content can cause early hypoglycemia and delayed postprandial glucose excursions. Some adjustments in insulin dosing, including an increase in the calculated dose and a split dose, will improve postprandial glucose management (13–17).

# Nutrition Therapy

# Recommendations

14.2 Individualized medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is recommended for youth with type 1 diabetes as an essential component of the overall treatment plan. A

14.3 Monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, is a key component to optimizing glycemic management. B

14.4 Advise youth with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers to strive for an eating pattern emphasizing key nutrition principles (including nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, fish and other lean protein, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and low-fat dairy products, and minimize consumption of red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, refined grains, and processed foods). B

14.5 Meal composition impacts postprandial glucose excursions. Education on the impact of high-fat and high-protein meals and the adjustment of insulin dosing is necessary. A

14.6 Strongly advise comprehensive nutrition education at diagnosis, and at least annually as needed, by an experienced registered dietitian nutritionist to assess the eating pattern in relation to weight status, age-appropriate growth, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. E

# Physical Activity and Exercise

# Recommendations

14.7 Physical activity is recommended for all youth with type 1 diabetes with the goal of 60 min of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic activity daily, with vigorous muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening activities at least 3 days per week. C

14.8 Advise frequent glucose monitoring before, during, and after exercise.

---

# Children and Adolescents

via blood glucose meter and/or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), to prevent, detect, and treat hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia associated with exercise.

# School and Child Care

As a large portion of a youth’s day is spent in school and/or daycare, training of school or daycare personnel to provide care in accordance with the child’s individualized diabetes medical management plan is essential for optimal diabetes management and safe access to all school- or daycare–sponsored opportunities (11,37,38). In addition, federal and state laws require schools, daycare facilities, and other entities to provide needed diabetes care to enable the child to safely access the school or daycare environment. Refer to the ADA position statements “Diabetes Care in the School Setting” (11) and “Care of Young Children With Diabetes in the Childcare and Community Setting” (38) and the ADA’s Safe at School website (diabetes.org/resources/know-your-rights/safe-at-school-state-laws) for additional details.

# Psychosocial Care

# Recommendations

14.11 At diagnosis and during routine follow-up care, screen youth with type 1 diabetes for psychosocial concerns (e.g., diabetes distress, depressive symptoms, and disordered eating), family factors, and behavioral health concerns that could impact diabetes management with age-appropriate standardized and validated tools. Refer to a qualified behavioral health professional, preferably experienced in childhood diabetes, when indicated. B

14.12 Behavioral health professionals should be considered integral members of the pediatric diabetes interprofessional team. E

14.13 Encourage developmentally appropriate family involvement in diabetes management tasks for children and adolescents, recognizing that premature or unsupportive transfer of diabetes care responsibility to the youth can contribute to diabetes distress, lower engagement in diabetes self-management behaviors, and deterioration in glycemia. A

14.14 Health care professionals should screen for food security, housing stability, health literacy, financial barriers, and social or community support and apply that information to treatment decisions. E

14.15 Health care professionals should consider asking youth and their parents about these factors to inform diabetes care.

or caregivers about social adjustment (peer relationships) and school performance to determine whether further intervention is needed. Youth with type 1 diabetes have an increased risk of disordered eating behavior as well as clinical eating disorders, with serious short-term and long-term negative effects on diabetes outcomes and health in general. It is important to recognize the unique and dangerous disordered eating behavior of insulin omission for weight management in type 1 diabetes.

Shared decision-making with youth regarding the adoption of management plan components and self-management behaviors can improve diabetes self-efficacy, participation in diabetes care, and glycemic outcomes. For example, well-designed decision aids can engage youth in comprehensive, unbiased conversations with their diabetes care team about treatment options. Other examples include creating self-care contracts and technology-integrated care that uses blood glucose records shared with the care team to facilitate shared decision-making. Importantly, health care professionals working with youth who are not yet able to provide legal consent must balance clinical oversight with promoting developmentally appropriate independence.

Recommendations include providing education tailored to the developmental stage, encouraging gradual responsibility with self-care, guiding parental involvement as responsibilities change, teaching self-advocacy to prepare for transitions in care, and incorporating psychosocial support at all stages. Although cognitive abilities vary, the ethical position often adopted is the “mature minor rule,” whereby children after age 12 or 13 years who appear to be mature have the right to consent or withhold consent to general medical treatment, except in cases in which refusal would significantly endanger health.

Beginning at the onset of puberty or at diagnosis of diabetes, all individuals with childbearing potential should receive education about the effective use of contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancy, as risks of fetal malformations are associated with elevated A1C. Preconception counseling using developmentally appropriate educational and behavioral strategies enables individuals of childbearing potential to make well-informed decisions. Preconception counseling resources tailored for adolescents are available at no cost through the ADA. Refer to the ADA position statement “Psychosocial Care for People With Diabetes” for further details.

The presence of a behavioral health professional on pediatric interprofessional teams highlights the importance of ongoing assessment of psychosocial status, social determinants of health, and diabetes distress in the youth and the parents or caregivers during routine diabetes visits.

# Children and Adolescents

of attending to the psychosocial issues of diabetes. These psychosocial factors are significantly related to self-management difficulties, elevated A1C, reduced quality of life, and higher rates of acute and chronic diabetes complications.

# Glycemic Monitoring, Insulin Delivery, and Goals

# Recommendations

14.18 All youth with type 1 diabetes should monitor glucose levels multiple times daily (up to 10 times/day by blood glucose meter or CGM), including prior to meals and snacks, at bedtime, and as needed for safety in specific situations such as physical activity, driving, or the presence of symptoms of hypoglycemia.

14.19 Real-time CGM A or intermittently scanned CGM C should be offered for diabetes management at diagnosis or as soon as possible in youth with diabetes on multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy who are capable of using the device safely (either by themselves or with caregivers). The choice of device should be made based on the individual’s and family’s circumstances, desires, and needs.

14.20 Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems should be offered for diabetes management to youth with type 1 diabetes who are capable of using the device safely (either by themselves or with caregivers). The choice of device should be made based on the individual’s and family’s circumstances, desires, and needs.

14.21 Insulin pump therapy alone should be offered for diabetes management to youth on multiple daily injections with type 1 diabetes who are capable of using the device safely (either by themselves or with caregivers) if unable to use AID systems. The choice of device should be made based on the individual’s and family’s circumstances, desires, and needs.

14.22 Students must be supported at school in the use of diabetes technology, including CGM, insulin pumps, connected insulin pens, and AID systems, as prescribed by their diabetes care team.

14.23 A1C goals must be individualized and reassessed over time. An A1C of <7% (<53 mmol/mol) is appropriate for many children and adolescents.

14.24 Less stringent A1C goals (such as <7.5% [<58 mmol/mol]) may be appropriate for youth who cannot articulate symptoms of hypoglycemia; have hypoglycemia unawareness; lack advanced insulin delivery technology and/or CGM; cannot check blood glucose regularly; or have nonglycemic factors that increase A1C (e.g., high glycators).

14.25 Even less stringent A1C goals (such as <8% [<64 mmol/mol]) may be appropriate for individuals with a history of severe hypoglycemia or limited life expectancy or where the harms of treatment are greater than the benefits.

14.26 Health care professionals may reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals (such as <6.5% [<48 mmol/mol]) for selected individuals if they can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, excessive weight gain, negative impacts on well-being, or undue burden of care or in those who have nonglycemic factors that decrease A1C (e.g., lower erythrocyte life span).

14.27 CGM metrics derived from CGM use over the most recent 14 days (or longer for youth with more glycemic variability), including time in range (70–180 mg/dL [3.9–10.0 mmol/L]), time below range (<70 mg/dL [<3.9 mmol/L] and <54 mg/dL [<3.0 mmol/L]), and time above range (>180 mg/dL [>10.0 mmol/L] and >250 mg/dL [>13.9 mmol/L]), are recommended to be used in conjunction with A1C whenever possible.

Current standards for diabetes management reflect the need to minimize hypoglycemia as safely as possible. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), which did not enroll children <13 years of age, demonstrated that near normalization of blood glucose levels was more difficult to achieve in adolescents than in adults. Nevertheless, the increased use of basal-bolus plans, insulin pumps, frequent blood glucose monitoring, CGM, AID systems, goal setting, and improved education has been associated with more children and adolescents reaching the blood glucose goals recommended by the ADA (67,68), particularly in families in which the parents or caregivers as well as the child with diabetes participate jointly to perform the required diabetes-related tasks.

Lower A1C in adolescence and young adulthood is associated with a lower risk and rate of microvascular and macrovascular complications (69–71) and demonstrates the effects of metabolic memory (72–75). In addition, type 1 diabetes can be associated with adverse effects on cognition during childhood and adolescence (6,76), and neurocognitive imaging differences related to hyperglycemia in children provide another motivation for achieving glycemic goals (6). Several factors, including young age, severe hypoglycemia at <6 years of age, DKA, and chronic hyperglycemia (76,77), contribute to adverse effects on brain development and function. However, meticulous use of therapeutic modalities such as rapid- and long-acting insulin analogs, technological advances (e.g., CGM, sensor-augmented pump therapy, and AID systems), and intensive self-management education now make it more feasible to achieve glycemic goals while reducing the incidence of severe hypoglycemia (78–99). Please refer to Section 7, “Diabetes Technology,” for more information on technology to support people with diabetes.

Recent data with newer devices and insulins indicate that the risk of hypoglycemia with lower A1C is less than it was before (100–108). In addition, achieving lower A1C levels is likely facilitated by setting lower A1C goals (109). Lower goals may be possible during the honeymoon phase of type 1 diabetes. Special consideration should be given to the risk of hypoglycemia in young children (aged <6 years) who are often unable to recognize, articulate, and/or manage hypoglycemia. However, registry data indicate that lower A1C goals can be achieved in children, including those aged <6 years, without increased risk of severe hypoglycemia (101). Recent data have demonstrated that the use of real-time CGM lowered A1C and increased TIR in adolescents and young adults and was associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia (110). Please refer to Section 6, “Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia,” for more information on glycemic assessment.

# Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

A strong relationship exists between diabetes, screening for thyroid dysfunction and celiac disease should be considered. Periodic screening in asymptomatic individuals has been recommended, but the optimal frequency of screening is unclear. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia and dyslipidemia and a reduced linear growth rate. Hyperthyroidism alters glucose metabolism and usually causes deterioration of glycemia.

# Celiac Disease

# Recommendations

- 14.31 Screen youth with type 1 diabetes for celiac disease by measuring IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies, with documentation of normal total serum IgA levels, soon after the diagnosis of diabetes, or IgG tTG and deamidated gliadin antibodies if IgA is deficient.
- 14.32 Repeat screening for celiac disease within 2 years of diabetes diagnosis and then again after 5 years and consider more frequent screening in youth who have symptoms or a first-degree relative with celiac disease.
- 14.33 Individuals with confirmed celiac disease should be placed on a gluten-free diet for treatment and to avoid complications. Youth and their caregivers should also have a consultation with a registered dietitian nutritionist experienced in managing both diabetes and celiac disease.

# Key Concepts in Setting Glycemic Goals

- Glycemic goals should be individualized, and lower goals may be reasonable based on a benefit-risk assessment.
- Blood glucose goals should be modified in children with frequent hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness.
- Postprandial blood glucose values should be measured when there is a discrepancy between preprandial blood glucose values and A1C levels and to assess preprandial insulin doses in those on basal-bolus or pump plans.

# Autoimmune Conditions

# Recommendation

14.28 Assess for additional autoimmune conditions soon after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and if clinically relevant.

Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common autoimmune disorder associated with diabetes, occurring in 17–30% of individuals with type 1 diabetes. At the time of diagnosis, 25% of children with type 1 diabetes have thyroid autoantibodies, the presence of which is predictive of thyroid dysfunction—most commonly hypothyroidism, although hyperthyroidism occurs in 0.5% of people with type 1 diabetes.

Because of the increased frequency of other autoimmune diseases in type 1 diabetes, screening should be considered at the time of diagnosis.

# Children and Adolescents

time of diagnosis and repeated at 2 and then 5 years (132) or if clinical symptoms indicate, such as poor growth or increased hypoglycemia (135).

Although celiac disease can be diagnosed more than 10 years after diabetes diagnosis, there are insufficient data after 5 years to determine the optimal screening frequency. Measurement of tTG antibody should be considered at other times in individuals with symptoms suggestive of celiac disease (132). Monitoring for symptoms should include an assessment of linear growth and weight gain (135). A small-bowel biopsy in antibody-positive children is recommended to confirm the diagnosis (138). European guidelines on screening for celiac disease in children (not specific to children with type 1 diabetes) suggest that biopsy may not be necessary in symptomatic children with high antibody titers (i.e., >10 times the upper limit of normal) provided that further testing is performed (verification of endomysial antibody positivity on a separate blood sample). Whether this approach may be appropriate for asymptomatic children in high-risk groups remains an open question, though evidence is emerging (139). It is also advisable to check for celiac disease–associated HLA types in individuals who are diagnosed without a small intestinal biopsy. In symptomatic children with type 1 diabetes and confirmed celiac disease, gluten-free diets reduce symptoms and rates of hypoglycemia (140). The challenging eating plan restrictions associated with having both type 1 diabetes and celiac disease place a significant burden on individuals. Therefore, a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease is recommended, especially in asymptomatic children, before establishing a diagnosis of celiac disease and endorsing significant eating plan changes.

# Management of Cardiovascular Risk Factors

# Hypertension Treatment Recommendations

14.35 Treatment of elevated blood pressure (defined as 90th to <95th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged ≥13 years, 120–129/<80 mmHg) is lifestyle modification focused on healthy nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and, if appropriate, weight management. C

14.36 After excluding other causes, in addition to lifestyle modification, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be started for treatment of confirmed hypertension (defined as blood pressure consistently ≥95th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged ≥13 years, ≥130/80 mmHg). Due to the potential teratogenic effects, individuals of childbearing age should receive reproductive counseling, and lipid-lowering medications should be avoided in most individuals of childbearing age who are not using reliable contraception. B

14.37 The goal of treatment is blood pressure <90th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged ≥13 years, <130/80 mmHg. C

# Dyslipidemia Treatment Recommendations

14.40 If lipids are abnormal, initial therapy should consist of optimizing glycemia and MNT to limit the amount of calories from fat to 25–30% and saturated fat to <7%, limit cholesterol to <200 mg/day, avoid trans fats, and aim for 10% calories from monounsaturated fats. A

14.41 Consider age-approved statins, in addition to MNT and lifestyle changes, for youth with type 1 diabetes who have LDL cholesterol ≥130 mg/dL (≥3.4 mmol/L). E Individuals of childbearing age should receive reproductive counseling, and lipid-lowering medications should be avoided in most individuals of childbearing age who are not using reliable contraception. B

14.42 The goal of therapy is an LDL cholesterol value <100 mg/dL (<2.6 mmol/L). E

# Hypertension Screening Recommendation

14.34 Blood pressure should be measured at every routine visit. In youth with high blood pressure (blood pressure ≥90th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged ≥13 years, blood pressure ≥120/80 mmHg) on three separate measurements, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be strongly considered. B

# Dyslipidemia Screening Recommendations

14.38 Initial lipid profile should be performed soon after diagnosis, preferably after glycemia has improved and age is ≥2 years. If initial LDL cholesterol is ≤100 mg/dL (≤2.6 mmol/L), subsequent testing should be performed at 9–11 years of age. B Initial testing may be done with a nonfasting lipid level with confirmatory testing with a fasting lipid panel.

14.39 If LDL cholesterol values are within the accepted risk level (<100 mg/dL), subsequent screening may be done at 9–11 years of age, which is a stable time.

Population-based studies estimate that 14–45% of children with type 1 diabetes have two or more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors (144–146), and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors increases with age (146) and among racial and ethnic minoritized groups (33), with girls having a higher risk burden than boys (145).

# Pathophysiology

The atherosclerotic process begins in childhood, and although atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events are not expected to occur during childhood, observations using a variety of methodologies show that youth with type 1 diabetes may have subclinical CVD within the first decade of diagnosis (147–149). Studies of carotid intima media thickness have yielded inconsistent results (142,143).

# Screening

Diabetes predisposes the individual to the development of accelerated arteriosclerosis. Lipid evaluation for these individuals contributes to risk assessment and identifies an important proportion of those with dyslipidemia. Therefore, initial screening should be done soon after diagnosis. If the initial screen is normal, subsequent screening may be done at 9–11 years of age, which is a stable time.

for lipid assessment in children (150). Long-term safety and cardiovascular outcome efﬁcacy of statin therapy have been established for children with familial hypercholesterolemia (161). At the time of this writing, rosuvastatin is indicated for children as young as 6 years old (162). Statins should be avoided in individuals of childbearing age who are not using reliable contraception (see Section 15, “Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy,” for more information). The multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Adolescent Type 1 Diabetes Cardio-Renal Intervention Trial (AdDIT) provides safety data on pharmacologic treatment with an ACE inhibitor and statin in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (142).

# Microvascular Complications

# Nephropathy Screening

Recommendation

14.43 Annual screening for albuminuria with a random (morning sample preferred to avoid effects of exercise) spot urine sample for albumin-to-creatinine ratio should be considered at puberty or at age >10 years, whichever is earlier, once the youth has had diabetes for 5 years. B

# Nephropathy Treatment

Recommendation

14.44 An ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, titrated to normalization of albumin excretion, may be considered when elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (>30 mg/g) is documented (two of three urine samples obtained over a 6-month interval following efforts to improve glycemia and normalize blood pressure). E

Due to the potential teratogenic effects, individuals of childbearing age should receive reproductive counseling, and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided in individuals of childbearing age who are not using reliable contraception. B

Data from 7,549 participants <20 years of age in the T1D Exchange clinic registry emphasize the importance of meeting glycemic and blood pressure goals, particularly as diabetes duration increases, to reduce the risk of diabetic kidney disease. The data also underscore the importance of routine screening to ensure early diagnosis and timely treatment of albuminuria (163). An estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), calculated with GFR-estimating equations using serum creatinine, height, age, and sex (164), should be considered at baseline and repeated as indicated based on clinical status, age, diabetes duration, and therapies. Improved methods are needed to screen for early GFR loss, since estimated GFR is inaccurate >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at GFR (164,165).

The AdDIT study in adolescents with type 1 diabetes demonstrated the safety of ACE inhibitor treatment, but the treatment did not change the albumin-to-creatinine ratio over the course of the study (142).

# Retinopathy

# Recommendations

14.45 An initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination is recommended once youth have had type 1 diabetes for 3–5 years, provided they are aged ≥11 years or puberty has started, whichever is earlier. B

14.46 After the initial examination, repeat dilated and comprehensive eye examination every 2 years. Less frequent examinations, every 4 years, may be acceptable on the advice of an eye care professional and based on risk factor assessment, including a history of A1C <8% (<64 mmol/mol). B

14.47 Programs that use retinal photography (with remote reading or use of a validated assessment tool) to improve access to diabetic retinopathy screening can be appropriate screening strategies for diabetic retinopathy. Such programs need to provide pathways for timely referral for a comprehensive eye examination when indicated. B

Retinopathy (like albuminuria) most commonly occurs after the onset of puberty and after 5–10 years of diabetes duration (166). It is currently recognized that there is a low risk of development of vision-threatening retinal lesions prior to 12 years of age (167,168). A 2019 publication based on the follow-up of the DCCT adolescent cohort supports a lower frequency of eye examinations than previously recommended, particularly in adolescents with A1C closer to the goal range (169,170). Autonomous artificial intelligence screening for diabetic retinopathy has been shown to increase access to this routine.

health maintenance (171). Referrals should be made to eye care professionals with expertise in diabetic retinopathy and experience in counseling pediatric individuals and families on the importance of prevention, early detection, and intervention.

# Neuropathy

# Recommendation

14.48 Consider an annual comprehensive foot exam at the start of puberty or at age ≥10 years, whichever is earlier, once the youth has had type 1 diabetes for 5 years. The examination should include inspection, assessment of foot pulses, pinprick, and 10-g monofilament sensation tests, testing of vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork, and ankle reflex tests. B

Diabetic neuropathy rarely occurs in prepubertal children or after only 1–2 years of diabetes (166), although data suggest a prevalence of distal peripheral neuropathy of 7% in 1,734 youth with type 1 diabetes and association with the presence of CVD risk factors (172,173). A comprehensive foot exam, including inspection, palpation of dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses, and determination of proprioception, vibration, and monofilament sensation, should be performed annually along with an assessment of symptoms of neuropathic pain (173). Foot inspection can be performed at each visit to educate youth regarding the importance of foot care (see Section 12, “Retinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Care”).

# Screening and Diagnosis

# Recommendations

14.49 Risk-based screening for prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or ≥10 years of age, whichever occurs earlier, in youth with overweight (BMI ≥85th percentile) or obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes (see Table 2.5 for evidence grading of other risk factors).

14.50 If screening is normal, repeat screening at a minimum of 2-year intervals or more frequently if BMI is increasing. C

14.51 Fasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and A1C can be used to test for prediabetes or diabetes in children and adolescents. B

14.52 Children and adolescents with overweight or obesity in whom the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is being considered should have a panel of diabetes-associated autoantibodies tested to exclude the possibility of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. B

# TYPE 2 DIABETES

For information on risk-based screening for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in youth, please refer to Section 2, “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes.” For additional support for these recommendations, see the ADA position statement “Evaluation and Management of Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes” (3).

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in youth has continued to increase over the past 20 years (4). The CDC published projections for type 2 diabetes prevalence using the SEARCH database. Assuming a 2.3% annual increase, the prevalence in those under 20 years of age will quadruple in 40 years (174,175).

Evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes in youth is different not only from type 1 diabetes but also from type 2 diabetes in adults and has unique features, such as a more rapidly progressive decline in b-cell function and accelerated development of diabetes complications (3,176). Long-term follow-up data from the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study reported most individuals with type 2 diabetes diagnosed as youth had microvascular complications by young adulthood (177).

Type 2 diabetes disproportionately impacts youth from historically marginalized communities and can occur in complex psychosocial and cultural environments, which may make it difficult to implement and sustain healthy lifestyle changes and self-management behaviors (9,178–181). Additional risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes in youth include obesity and excess adiposity (182), family history of diabetes possibly mediated by shared genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors (183), female sex, maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (184), and adverse social determinants of health (176).

As with type 1 diabetes, youth with type 2 diabetes spend much of the day in school. Therefore, close communication with and the cooperation of school personnel are essential for optimal diabetes management and safety and maximal academic opportunities.

Given the current obesity epidemic, distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in children can be difficult. Overweight and obesity are common in children with type 1 diabetes (34), and diabetes-associated autoantibodies and ketosis may be present in pediatric individuals with clinical features of type 2 diabetes (including obesity and acanthosis nigricans) (187). The presence of islet autoantibodies has been associated with faster progression to insulin deficiency (187).

At the onset of diabetes, DKA occurs in 11% of youth aged 10–19 years with type 2 diabetes (191). Although uncommon, type 2 diabetes has been observed in prepubertal children under the age of 10 years, thus it should be part of the differential in children with suggestive symptoms (192). Finally, obesity contributes to the development of type 1 diabetes in some individuals (193), which further complicates the clinical picture.

blurs the lines between diabetes types. We must acknowledge that people with type 1 diabetes can also experience weight gain and insulin resistance. However, accurate diagnosis is critical, as treatment plans, educational approaches, nutrition advice, and outcomes differ markedly between individuals with predominantly insulin resistance and absolute insulinopenia phenotypes. The significant diagnostic difficulties posed by maturity-onset diabetes of the young are discussed in Section 2, “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes.” In addition, there are rare and atypical diabetes cases that represent a challenge for clinicians and researchers.

# Management

# Lifestyle Management

# Recommendations

- 14.53 All youth with type 2 diabetes and their families should receive comprehensive DSMES that is specific to youth with type 2 diabetes and is culturally appropriate. B
- 14.54 Youth with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes and their families should be provided with developmentally and culturally appropriate comprehensive lifestyle programs that are integrated with diabetes management to achieve at least a 7–10% decrease in excess weight. B
- 14.55 Given the necessity of long-term weight management for youth with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle intervention should be based on a chronic care model and offered in the context of diabetes care. E
- 14.56 Youth with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, like all children and adolescents, should be encouraged to participate in at least 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily (with muscle and bone strength training at least 3 days/week) B and to decrease sedentary recreational screen time. C
- 14.57 Nutrition for youth with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, like for all children and adolescents, should focus on key nutrition principles (i.e., eat more nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and low-fat dairy products and eat less meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, refined grains, and processed or ultraprocessed foods). B

# Pharmacologic Management

# Recommendations

- 14.61 Initiate pharmacologic therapy, in addition to behavioral counseling for healthful nutrition and physical activity changes, at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. A
- 14.62 In individuals with incidentally diagnosed or metabolically stable diabetes (A1C <8.5% [<69 mmol/mol] and asymptomatic), metformin is the initial pharmacologic treatment of choice if kidney function is normal. A
- 14.63 Youth with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥250 mg/dL [$13.9 mmol/L], A1C ≥8.5% [$69 mmol/mol]) without acidosis at diagnosis who are symptomatic with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and/or weight loss should be treated initially with long-acting insulin while metformin is initiated and titrated. B
- 14.64 Initiate subcutaneous or intravenous insulin treatment in individuals with ketoacidosis to rapidly correct the hyperglycemia and the metabolic derangement. Once acidosis is resolved, metformin should be initiated while subcutaneous insulin therapy is continued. A
- 14.65 In individuals presenting with severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥600 mg/dL [$33.3 mmol/L]), consider assessment for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state. A

Glycemic goals should be individualized, taking into consideration the long-term health benefits of more stringent goals and risk for adverse effects, such as hypoglycemia. A lower A1C goal of <6.5% in youth with type 2 diabetes compared with <7% recommended in type 1 diabetes is justified by a lower risk of hypoglycemia and higher risk of...

complications in youth with type 2 diabetes (177,195–199).

Self-management in pediatric diabetes involves both the youth and their parents or adult caregivers. Individuals and their families should receive education and support for healthful nutrition and physical activity, such as a balanced meal plan, achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, and regular physical activity. Physical activity should include aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and bone-strengthening activities (24). A family-centered approach to nutrition and lifestyle modification is essential in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes, and nutrition recommendations should be culturally appropriate and sensitive to family resources (see Section 5, "Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes"). Given the complex social and environmental context surrounding youth with type 2 diabetes, individual-level lifestyle interventions may not be sufficient to address the complex interplay of family dynamics, behavioral health, community readiness, and the broader environmental system (3).

An interprofessional diabetes team, including a physician, diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES), registered dietitian nutritionist, and behavioral health specialist or social worker, is essential. In addition to achieving glycemic goals and self-management education (200–202), initial treatment must include management of comorbidities such as obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and microvascular complications.

Current pharmacologic treatment options for youth-onset type 2 diabetes are limited to four approved drug classes: insulin, metformin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. Presentation with ketoacidosis or marked ketosis requires a period of insulin therapy until fasting and postprandial glycemia have been restored to normal or near-normal levels. Insulin pump therapy may be considered as an option for those on long-term multiple daily injections who are able to safely manage the device. Initial treatment should also be with insulin when the distinction between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes is unclear and in individuals who have random blood glucose concentrations ≥250 mg/dL (≥13.9 mmol/L) and/or A1C ≥8.5% (≥69 mmol/mol) (203). Metformin therapy should be added after resolution of ketosis or ketoacidosis.

When initial insulin treatment is not required, initiation of metformin is recommended as first-line therapy. The TODAY study found that metformin alone provided durable glycemic management (A1C

#8% [#64 mmol/mol] for 6 months) in with type 2 diabetes who have class 2 obesity or higher (BMI >35 kg/m2 or >120% of 95th percentile for age and sex, whichever is lower) and who have elevated A1C and/or serious comorbidities despite lifestyle and pharmacologic intervention. A

The Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Consortium study did not demonstrate differences in measures of glucose or b-cell function preservation between metformin and insulin, but there was more weight gain with insulin (205).

To date, the TODAY study is the only trial combining lifestyle and metformin therapy in youth with type 2 diabetes; the combination did not perform better than metformin alone in achieving durable glycemic levels (204).

Randomized controlled trials in youth have shown that GLP-1 receptor agonists are safe and effective for decreasing A1C (206–210) and promoting weight loss at higher doses approved for obesity (211). Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists can increase the frequency of gastrointestinal side effects and should not be used in individuals with a family history of medullary thyroid cancer.

In addition to GLP-1 receptor agonists, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors are well-studied drugs in adults with type 2 diabetes, and empagliflozin is now approved for use in youth with type 2 diabetes. In a recent multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 158 children with type 2 diabetes aged between 10 and 17 years were randomized to 10 mg empagliflozin, 5 mg linagliptin, or placebo. Participants in the empagliflozin group who did not have A1C below 7.0% by week 12 underwent a second double-blinded randomization at week 14 to either remain on 10 mg of empagliflozin or increase their dose to 25 mg. In the empagliflozin pooled group compared with the placebo group, there was a significant reduction in A1C of 0.84% (P = 0.012). There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia during the study (212).

Blood glucose monitoring plans should be individualized, taking into consideration the pharmacologic treatment of the person. Although data on CGM in youth with type 2 diabetes are sparse (213,214), CGM could be considered in individuals requiring frequent blood glucose monitoring for diabetes management.

# Prevention and Management of Diabetes Complications

# Hypertension Recommendations

14.72 Blood pressure should be measured at every clinic visit. In youth with high blood pressure (blood pressure $ 90th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged $13 years, $120/80 mmHg) on three separate measurements, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be strongly considered. B

14.73 After excluding secondary hypertension, treatment of elevated blood pressure (defined as 90th to <95th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged $13 years, 120–129/<80 mmHg) is lifestyle modification focused on healthy nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and, if appropriate, weight management. C

14.74 In addition to lifestyle modification, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be started for treatment of confirmed hypertension (defined as blood pressure consistently $95th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged $13 years, $130/80 mmHg). Due to the potential teratogenic effects, individuals of childbearing age should receive reproductive counseling, and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided in individuals of childbearing age who are not using reliable contraception. B

14.75 The goal of treatment is blood pressure <90th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged $13 years, <130/80 mmHg. C

# Nephropathy Recommendations

14.76 Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio should be obtained at the time of diagnosis and annually thereafter. An elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (>30 mg/g creatinine) should be confirmed on two of three samples. B

# Metabolic Surgery Recommendations

14.70 Metabolic surgery may be considered for the treatment of adolescents with class 2 obesity or higher (BMI >35 kg/m2 or >120% of 95th percentile for age and sex, whichever is lower, with or without comorbidities) (221–227). A number of groups, including the Pediatric Bariatric Study Group and Teen-LABS study, have demonstrated the effectiveness of metabolic surgery in adolescents (221–225). However, long-term data on the rates of complications, reoperations, nutritional deficiencies, and diabetes recurrence are still needed.

# Children and Adolescents

14.77 Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be determined at the time of diagnosis and annually thereafter. E

14.78 In youth with diabetes and hypertension, either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker is recommended for those with modestly elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (30–299 mg/g creatinine) and should be considered for those with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio >300 mg/g <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. creatinine and/or estimated GFR E

Due to the potential teratogenic effects, individuals of childbearing age should receive reproductive counseling, and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided in individuals of childbearing age who are not using reliable contraception. B

14.79 For youth with nephropathy, continue monitoring (yearly and/or as indicated by urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated GFR) to detect disease progression. E

14.80 Referral to nephrology is recommended in case of uncertainty of etiology, worsening urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, or decrease in estimated GFR. E

# Dyslipidemia Recommendations

14.93 Lipid screening should be performed initially after optimizing glycemia and annually thereafter. B

14.94 Optimal goals are LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dL (<2.6 mmol/L), HDL cholesterol >35 mg/dL (>0.91 mmol/L), and triglycerides <150 mg/dL (<1.7 mmol/L). E

14.95 If lipids are abnormal, initial therapy should consist of optimizing glycemia and medical nutritional therapy to limit the amount of calories from fat to 25–30% and saturated fat to <7%, limit cholesterol to <200 mg/day, avoid trans fats, and aim for 10% calories from monounsaturated fats for elevated LDL. For elevated triglycerides, MNT should also focus on decreasing carbohydrate intake and increasing dietary n-3 fatty acids in addition to the above changes. A

14.96 If LDL cholesterol remains >130 mg/dL (>3.4 mmol/L) after 6 months of dietary intervention, initiate therapy with statin, with a goal of LDL <100 mg/dL (<2.6 mmol/L).

# Metabolic Dysfunction–Associated Steatotic Liver Disease Recommendations

14.87 Evaluation of youth with type 2 diabetes for metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (by measuring AST and ALT) should be done at diagnosis and annually thereafter. B

14.88 Referral to gastroenterology should be considered for persistently elevated or worsening transaminases. B

# Obstructive Sleep Apnea Recommendation

14.89 Screening for symptoms of sleep apnea should be done at each visit, and referral to a pediatric sleep specialist for evaluation and a polysomnogram, if indicated, is recommended. Obstructive sleep apnea should be treated when documented. B

# Neuropathy Recommendations

14.81 Youth with type 2 diabetes should be screened for the presence of neuropathy by foot examination at diagnosis and annually. The examination should include inspection, assessment of foot pulses, pinprick and 10-g monoﬁlament sensation tests, testing of vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork, and ankle reflex tests. C

14.82 Prevention of neuropathy should focus on achieving glycemic goals. C

# Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Recommendations

14.90 Evaluate for polycystic ovary syndrome in female adolescents with type 2 diabetes, including laboratory studies, when indicated. B

14.91 Metformin, in addition to lifestyle modification, is likely to improve the menstrual cyclicity and hyperandrogenism in female individuals with type 2 diabetes. E

# Cardiac Function Testing Recommendation

14.98 Routine screening for heart disease with electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or stress testing is not recommended in asymptomatic youth with type 2 diabetes. B

# Cardiovascular Disease

14.92 Intensive lifestyle interventions focusing on weight loss, dyslipidemia, comorbidities may already be present at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in youth (176,228). Therefore, blood pressure measurement, a fasting lipid

panel, assessment of random urine attention to symptoms of depression The TODAY study documented high rates of maternal complications during pregnancy and low rates of preconception counseling and contraception use in youth with type 2 diabetes (241). Preconception counseling tailored for adolescents with diabetes (including type 2 diabetes) has sustained behavioral benefits (65).

# SUBSTANCE USE IN PEDIATRIC DIABETES

# Tobacco, Electronic Cigarettes, Alcohol, and Cannabis

# Recommendations

14.101 Starting at puberty, preconception counseling should be incorporated into routine diabetes clinic visits for all individuals of childbearing potential because of the adverse pregnancy outcomes in this population. A

14.102 Adolescents and young adults should be screened for tobacco or nicotine, electronic cigarettes, substance use, and alcohol use at diagnosis and regularly thereafter. C

14.103 Elicit a smoking history at initial and follow-up diabetes visits; discourage smoking in youth who do not smoke and encourage smoking cessation in those who do smoke. A

14.104 Electronic cigarette use or vaping should be discouraged. A

14.105 Advise all youth with diabetes not to use cannabis recreationally in any form. E

The adverse health effects of smoking and use of tobacco products are well recognized with respect to future cancer and CVD risk. Despite this, smoking rates are significantly higher among youth with diabetes than among youth without diabetes (242). In youth with diabetes, it is important to avoid additional CVD risk factors. Smoking increases the risk of the onset of albuminuria; therefore, smoking avoidance is important to prevent both microvascular and macrovascular complications (150). Discouraging use of tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes (243, 244), is an important part of routine diabetes care. Individuals with diabetes should be advised to avoid vaping and using electronic cigarettes, either as a way to stop smoking tobacco or as a recreational drug. In younger children, it is important to assess exposure to cigarette smoke in the home because of the adverse effects of secondhand smoke and to discourage youth from ever smoking.

As alcohol use has implications for glycemic management and safety in youth and young adults with diabetes, efforts are warranted to reduce alcohol use and...

---

# Children and Adolescents

Increase education about the risks of alcohol use and strategies to minimize risks. A psychoeducational intervention for adolescents with chronic medical conditions, including type 1 diabetes, has demonstrated benefits for knowledge, perceived benefits, and reduced use (245). See also Section 5, “Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes.”

Finally, increased legalization and multiple formulations of cannabis products have resulted in increased use of these products among youth and young adults. In 2022, 30.7% of 12th graders reported using cannabis in the past year and 6.3% reported using it daily over the past 30 days (246). Cannabis users with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk for hyperglycemic ketosis due to cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (severe nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting) (247). For youth with type 1 diabetes presenting with a hyperglycemic emergency, health care professionals should consider cannabis hyperemesis syndrome in individuals with pH $7.4 and bicarbonate >15 mmol/L in the presence of ketosis (247). Routine diabetes care should discourage the use of recreational cannabis in all forms. See Section 5, “Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes,” for more information about smoking cessation, tobacco, electronic cigarettes, and cannabis in people with diabetes.

The transfer period from pediatric to adult care is prone to fragmentation in health care delivery, which may adversely impact health care quality, cost, and outcomes (251). Worsening diabetes health outcomes during the transition to adult care and early adulthood have been documented (252,253).

# TRANSITION FROM PEDIATRIC TO ADULT CARE

# Recommendations

14.106 Diabetes care teams should implement transition preparation programs for youth beginning in early adolescence and, at the latest, at least 1 year before the anticipated transfer from pediatric to adult health care.

14.107 Interprofessional adult and pediatric health care teams should provide support and resources for adolescents, young adults, and their families prior to and during the transfer process from pediatric to adult health care.

14.108 Pediatric diabetes specialists should partner with youth with diabetes and their caregivers to engage in shared decision-making for the timing of transfer to an adult diabetes specialist. There is no age-specific cutoff for youth with diabetes to transfer to an adult diabetes specialist.
