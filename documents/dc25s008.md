The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” includes the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, an interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system for ADA’s clinical practice recommendations and a full list of Professional Practice Committee members, please refer to Introduction and Methodology. Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.

Obesity is a chronic, often relapsing disease with numerous metabolic, physical, and psychosocial complications, including a substantially increased risk for the development and progression of type 2 diabetes (1). There is strong and consistent evidence that obesity management can delay the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes (2–6) and is highly beneficial in treating type 2 diabetes (7–15). In people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, modest weight loss improves glycemia and reduces the need for glucose-lowering medications (7,16,17), and greater weight loss substantially reduces A1C and fasting glucose and may promote sustained diabetes remission (9,18–22). Metabolic surgery, which results in an average >20% body weight loss, greatly improving glycemia and often leading to remission of diabetes, improved quality of life, improved cardiovascular outcomes, and reduced mortality (23,24). Several therapeutic modalities, including intensive behavioral and lifestyle counseling, weight management pharmacotherapy, and metabolic surgery, may aid in achieving and maintaining meaningful weight loss and reducing obesity-associated health risks. This section aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for obesity management, including behavioral, pharmacologic, and surgical interventions, in people with, or at high risk of, type 2 diabetes. Additional considerations regarding weight management in older individuals and children can be found in Section 13, “Older Adults,” and Section 14, “Children and Adolescents.”

# Obesity and Weight Management

# Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

“person with obesity” rather than “obese person” and “person with diabetes” rather than “diabetic person”).

# 8.2a

To support the diagnosis of obesity, measure height and weight to calculate BMI and perform additional measurements of body fat distribution, like waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and/or waist-to-height ratio if BMI is indeterminant.

# 8.2b

Monitor obesity-related anthropometric measurements at least annually to inform treatment considerations. During active weight management treatment, increase monitoring to at least every 3 months.

# 8.3

Accommodations should be made to provide privacy during anthropometric measurements.

# 8.4

In people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, weight management should represent a primary goal of treatment along with glycemic management.

# 8.5

Provide weight management treatment, aiming for any magnitude of weight loss. Weight loss of 3–7% of baseline weight improves glycemia and other intermediate cardiovascular risk factors. A sustained loss of >10% of body weight usually confers greater benefits, including disease-modifying effects and possible remission of type 2 diabetes, and may improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.

# 8.6

Individualize initial treatment approaches for obesity (i.e., lifestyle and nutritional therapy, pharmacologic agents, or metabolic surgery) based on the person’s medical history, life circumstances, preferences, and motivation. Consider combining treatment approaches if appropriate.

Weight stigma, fat bias, and anti-fat bias are ways to describe the bias toward people living in larger bodies. Fat bias is prevalent among health care professionals and the general public. Health care professionals are strongly encouraged to increase their awareness of implicit and explicit weight-biased attitudes. Increasing empathy and understanding about the complexity of weight management among health care professionals is a useful avenue to help reduce weight bias.

A person-centered communication style that uses inclusive and nonjudgmental language and active listening to elicit individual preferences and beliefs and assesses potential barriers to care should be used to optimize health outcomes and health-related quality of life. Use person-first language (e.g., “person with obesity”).

Combination treatment approaches may be appropriate in higher-risk individuals. Among people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity who have inadequate glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid management and/or other obesity-related metabolic complications, modest and...

# Obesity and Weight Management

Sustained weight loss (3–7% of body weight) improves glycemia, blood pressure, and lipids and may reduce the need for disease-specific medications (7,16,17,42). In people at risk, 3–7% weight loss reduces progression to diabetes (2,16,17,43,44). Greater weight loss produces additional benefits (20,21). Mounting data have shown that >10% body weight loss usually confers greater benefits on glycemia and diabetes remission and improves other metabolic comorbidities, including cardiovascular outcomes, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH), MASLD, adipose tissue inflammation, and sleep apnea, as well as physical comorbidities and quality of life (6,20,21,30,43,45–54).

With the increasing availability of more effective treatments, individuals with diabetes and overweight or obesity should be informed of the potential benefits of both modest and more substantial weight loss and guided in the range of available treatment options, as discussed in the sections below. Shared decision-making should be used when counseling on behavioral changes, intervention choices, and weight management goals.

# NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND BEHAVIORAL THERAPY

# Recommendations

8.7 Nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral therapy are recommended for people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity to achieve both weight and health outcome goals. B

8.8a Interventions including high frequency of counseling (≥16 sessions in 6 months) with focus on nutrition changes, physical activity, and behavioral strategies to achieve a 500–750 kcal/day energy deficit should be recommended for weight loss and should be considered when available. A

8.8b If access to such interventions is limited, consider alternative structured programs delivering behavioral counseling (face-to-face or remote). E

8.9 Nutrition recommendations should be individualized to the person’s preferences and nutritional needs. Use nutritional plans that create an energy deficit, regardless of macronutrient composition, to achieve weight loss. A

8.10 When developing a plan of care, consider systemic, structural, cultural, and socioeconomic factors.

# Behavioral Interventions

Numerous behavioral interventions have demonstrated positive effects from reducing energy intake, increasing physical activity, or some combination of these key lifestyle behaviors (56). The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial confirmed the feasibility of achieving and maintaining long-term weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. Approximately half of intensive lifestyle intervention participants lost and maintained ≥5% of their initial body weight (44). Tailoring behavioral interventions to cultural context could be an additional useful tool for improving the impact of interventions (57–59).

# Nutrition Interventions

8.11 For those who achieve weight loss goals, continue to monitor progress, provide ongoing support, and recommend continuing interventions to maintain weight goals long term. E Effective long-term (≥1 year) weight maintenance programs provide monthly contact and support, include frequent self-monitoring of body weight (weekly or more frequently) and other self-monitoring strategies (e.g., food diaries or wearables), and encourage regular physical activity (200–300 min/week). A

8.12 Short-term nutrition intervention using structured, very-low-calorie meals (800–1,000 kcal/day) should be prescribed only to carefully selected individuals by trained practitioners in medical settings with close monitoring.

8.13 Nutritional supplements have not been shown to be effective for weight loss and are not recommended. A Reducing processed and ultraprocessed food intake is also an encouraging area of ongoing weight loss research.

# Additional Insights

The Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies (POUNDS) Lost trial reported small but significant improvements when ultraprocessed foods were replaced isocalorically by less processed foods, with improved trunk fat loss (b = 3.9, 95% CI 7.01 to 0.70, P = 0.02) (65). The specific nutrition and lifestyle choices should be based on the individual’s health status, clinical considerations, social determinants of health, overall preferences, and other cultural and personal circumstances that affect eating and activity patterns (66).

face-to-face or remotely and on an individual or group basis (60,67,68). Assessing a person’s motivation level, life circumstances, cultural considerations, socioeconomic factors, and ability to implement behavioral changes to achieve weight loss should be considered along with medical status when such interventions are recommended and initiated (40,69).

People with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity who have lost weight should be offered long-term ($1 year) comprehensive weight loss maintenance programs. Weight loss maintenance programs should be delivered by an interprofessional team with appropriate training and experience in implementing long-term weight maintenance programs. While we acknowledge that most insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid are not currently covering many long-term weight maintenance programs, there is evidence to support their effectiveness and benefits (44,60,70) on both personal and population levels.

Weight maintenance programs should include at least monthly contact with trained individuals and focus on ongoing monitoring of body weight (weekly or more frequently) and/or other self-monitoring strategies such as tracking food and beverage intake and steps; continued focus on nutrition and behavioral changes; and participation in high levels of physical activity (200–300 min/week) (71,72).

Some commercial and proprietary weight loss programs have shown promising weight loss results; however, results vary across programs, most lack evidence of effectiveness, many do not satisfy guideline recommendations, and some promote unscientific and possibly dangerous practices (73,74).

Structured, very-low-calorie eating patterns, typically 800–1,000 kcal/day, using high-protein foods and meal replacement products, may increase the pace and/or magnitude of initial weight loss and glycemic improvements compared with standard behavioral interventions (20,21). However, such intensive nutritional interventions should be provided only by trained and experienced professionals in medical settings with close ongoing monitoring and integration with behavioral support and counseling, and only for a short term (generally up to 3 months).

Furthermore, due to the high risk of complications (electrolyte abnormalities, severe fatigue, cardiac arrhythmias, etc.), such intensive interventions should be prescribed only to carefully selected individuals, such as those requiring weight loss and/or glycemic management before surgery, if benefits exceed potential risks (75–77).

# Glucose-Lowering Therapy

Numerous effective glucose-lowering medications are currently available. However, to achieve both glycemic and weight management goals for diabetes treatment, health care professionals should prioritize the use of glucose-lowering medications with a beneficial effect on weight. Agents associated with clinically meaningful weight loss include glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) and a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA (tirzepatide).

# Recommendations

8.15 When choosing glucose-lowering medications for people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, prioritize medications with beneficial effect on weight.

8.16 Weight management pharmacotherapy should be considered for people with diabetes and overweight or obesity along with lifestyle changes. Potential benefits and risks must be considered.

8.17 In people with diabetes and overweight or obesity, the preferred pharmacotherapy should be a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist or dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist with greater weight loss efficacy (i.e., semaglutide or tirzepatide), especially considering their added weight-independent benefits (e.g., glycemic and cardiometabolic).

8.18 Screen people with diabetes and obesity who have lost significant weight for malnutrition, especially those who have undergone metabolic surgery and those treated with weight management pharmacologic therapy.

8.19 Weight management pharmacotherapy indicated for chronic therapy should be continued beyond reaching weight loss goals to maintain the health benefits. Sudden discontinuation of weight management pharmacotherapy often results in weight gain and worsening of cardiometabolic risk factors.

8.20 For those not reaching treatment goals, reevaluate weight management therapies and intensify treatment with additional approaches (e.g., metabolic surgery, additional pharmacologic agents, and structured lifestyle management programs).

# Obesity and Weight Management

cotransporter 2 inhibitors, metformin, acar-              receptor agonist, is approved for use in                  and semaglutide 1 mg (doses approved for type 2 diabetes, which are lower than those approved for the treatment of obesity) demonstrated reduction in cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes who are either at high risk for cardiovascular disease or have cardiovascular disease (51,94). Additionally, semaglutide 2.4 mg (dose approved for the treatment of obesity) also demonstrated reduction in cardiovascular events in people with overweight or obesity and preexistent cardiovascular disease but without diabetes (95).

# Concomitant Medications

Health care professionals should carefully review the individual’s concomitant medications and, whenever possible, minimize or provide alternatives for medications that promote weight gain (86). Examples of medications associated with weight gain include antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone), some antidepressants (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors), glucocorticoids, injectable progestins, some anticonvulsants (e.g., gabapentin and pregabalin), b-blockers (e.g., atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol), and possibly sedating antihistamines and anticholinergics (87).

# Approved Weight Management Pharmacotherapy

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several medications for weight management as adjuncts to a reduced-calorie eating pattern and increased physical activity in individuals with BMI ≥30 kg/m² or ≥27 kg/m² with one or more obesity-associated comorbid conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and/or dyslipidemia). Nearly all FDA-approved weight management medications have been shown to improve glycemia in people with type 2 diabetes and delay progression to type 2 diabetes in at-risk individuals (22), and some of these agents (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide) have an indication for glucose lowering as well as weight management.

Phentermine and other older adrenergic agents are approved for short-term treatment (88), while all others are approved for long-term treatment (22) (Tables 8.1 and 8.2). (Refer to Section 14, “Children and Adolescents,” for medications approved for adolescents with obesity.) In addition, setmelanotide, a melanocortin 4 receptor agonist, is approved for use in cases of rare genetic mutations resulting in severe hyperphagia and extreme obesity, such as leptin receptor deficiency and proopiomelanocortin deficiency.

# Weight Management Pharmacotherapy

Weight management pharmacotherapy has demonstrated multiple additional benefits beyond weight loss and improvement in glucose management. Some such examples include improvements or potential improvements in cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., blood pressure and lipids), inflammation, obstructive sleep apnea, MASLD and MASH, and symptoms related to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (90–93). Liraglutide 1.8 mg resulted in a body weight loss of 6.2% more than placebo and A1C lowering of 1.2% more than placebo after 68 weeks (50). In the Efficacy and Safety of Tirzepatide Once Weekly in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Who Have Obesity or Are Overweight: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial (SURMOUNT-2), tirzepatide resulted in body weight loss of 9.6% and 11.6% more than placebo and A1C lowering of 1.55% and 1.57% more than placebo after 72 weeks of treatment with the 10 mg and 15 mg doses, respectively, with adverse effects similar to those seen with the GLP-1 RA class (89).

Individuals of childbearing potential should receive counseling regarding the use of reliable methods of contraception while using weight loss medications. Tirzepatide in particular may reduce the efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives due to delayed gastric emptying, an effect that is largest after the first dose and diminishes over time. Individuals using oral hormonal contraceptives should switch to a nonoral contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation.

Of note, while weight loss medications are often used in people with type 1 diabetes, clinical trial data in this population are limited. Incretin pharmacotherapies and metabolic surgery options for weight loss may increase the risk for malnutrition and sarcopenia (96). Health care professionals should encourage resistance training (97) and sufficient protein intake. Individuals with diabetes who are experiencing significant (>20%) or rapid (>4 kg/month) weight loss should be screened for.

malnutrition. While no single method is
best to screen for both malnutrition and
sarcopenia, instruments are available to
screen for each condition, including the
Simplified Nutritional Appetite Question-
naire (SNAQ) and the Malnutrition Uni-
versal Screening Tool (MUST) (98–100).
For a more detailed discussion of malnu-
trition in the context of diabetes and
weight loss, see Section 5, "Facilitating
Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being
to Improve Health Outcomes."

Thus, choice of therapy should be guided
by person-centered treatment factors, in-
cluding comorbidities, considerations of
adverse effects and treatment burden,
treatment cost and accessibility, and the
individual's therapeutic goals and prefer-
ences. Medication cost and insurance
coverage considerations often influence
treatment decisions, and payors should
cover evidence-based obesity treatments
for people with diabetes and prediabetes
to reduce barriers to treatment access. It is
also essential that health care teams are
knowledgeable about insurance coverage
requirements and establish systems to
support clinicians in prescribing evidence-
based weight management medications

and to reduce financial hardship of treat-
ment for individuals, including formulary
and medication coverage requirements,
eligibility for medication assistance pro-
grams, and availability of copayment re-
duction cards (see Section 1, "Improving
Care and Promoting Health in Populations").

Assessing Efficacy and Safety of Weight
Management Pharmacotherapy
Upon initiating medications for obesity, as-
sess their effectiveness and safety at least
monthly for the first 3 months and at least
quarterly thereafter. Modeling from pub-
lished clinical trials consistently shows that
early responders have improved long-term
outcomes (101,102); however, it is notable
that the response rate with the latest gen-
eration of weight management pharmaco-
therapies is much higher (50,89). Unless
clinical circumstances (such as poor tolera-
bility) or other considerations (such as fi-
nancial expense or individual preference)
suggest otherwise, those who achieve suf-
ficient early weight loss upon starting a
chronic weight management medication
(typically defined as >5% weight loss after
3 months of use) should continue the med-
ication long-term. When early weight loss

results are modest (typically <5% weight
loss after 3 months of use), the benefits of
ongoing treatment need to be examined in
the context of the glycemic response,
the availability of other potential treat-
ment options, treatment tolerance, and
overall treatment burden. Ongoing mon-
itoring of the achievement and mainte-
nance of weight management goals is
recommended. Sudden discontinuation of
semaglutide and tirzepatide results in re-
gain of one-half to two-thirds of the
weight loss within 1 year (103–105).
Shared decision-making should be used to
determine the best long-term weight
management approach, such as continu-
ing pharmacotherapy on the lowest effec-
tive dose, using intermittent therapy, or
stopping medication followed by close
weight monitoring.

For those not reaching or maintaining
weight-related treatment goals, avoid treat-
ment inertia by reevaluating ongoing weight
management therapies and intensify treat-
ment with additional approaches (e.g., met-
abolic surgery, additional pharmacologic
agents, and structured lifestyle manage-
ment programs).

# Obesity and Weight Management

# MEDICAL DEVICES FOR WEIGHT LOSS

While gastric banding devices have fallen out of favor due to their limited long-term efficacy and high rate of complications, several minimally invasive medical devices have been approved by the FDA for short-term weight loss, including implanted gastric balloons, a vagus nerve stimulator, and gastric aspiration therapy (106). High cost, limited insurance coverage, and limited data supporting the efficacy of these devices in the treatment of individuals with diabetes has created uncertainty for their current use and led to the voluntary removal of several of these medical devices from the U.S. market (107).

# METABOLIC SURGERY

# Recommendations

8.21 Consider metabolic surgery as a weight and glycemic management approach in people with diabetes with $30.0 kg/m2 (or $27.5 kg/m2 in Asian American individuals) who are otherwise good surgical candidates. A

8.22 Metabolic surgery should be performed in high-volume centers with interprofessional teams knowledgeable about and experienced in managing obesity, diabetes, and gastrointestinal surgery (www.facs.org/quality-programs/accreditation-and-verification/metabolic-and-bariatric-surgery-accreditation-and-quality-improvement-program/). E

8.23 People being considered for metabolic surgery should be evaluated for comorbid psychological conditions and social and situational circumstances that have the potential to interfere with surgery outcomes. B

8.24 People who undergo metabolic surgery should receive long-term medical and behavioral support and routine micronutrient, nutritional, and metabolic status monitoring. B

8.25 If post–metabolic surgery hypoglycemia is suspected, clinical evaluation should exclude other potential disorders contributing to hypoglycemia, and management should include education, medical nutrition therapy with a registered dietitian nutritionist experienced in post–metabolic surgery hypoglycemia, and medication treatment, as needed. A

# Surgical procedures for obesity treatment

Often referred to interchangeably as bariatric surgery, weight loss surgery, metabolic surgery, or metabolic/bariatric surgery—can promote significant and durable weight loss and improve glycemic management and long-term outcomes in those with type 2 diabetes. Given the magnitude and rapidity of improvement of hyperglycemia and glucose homeostasis, these procedures have been suggested as treatments for type 2 diabetes even in the absence of severe obesity (108).

# Outcomes

A real-world data analysis through the National Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) in the U.S. compared surgical outcomes between 6,233 individuals with type 2 diabetes who underwent RYGB and 3,477 who underwent VSG. At 1 year after surgery, those who had RYGB lost on average 29.1% of their total body weight, while those who had VSG lost on average 22.8% of their total body weight. At 5 years after surgery, the total body weight loss was 24.1% for those who had RYGB and 16.1% for those who had VSG, with 86.1% of individuals experiencing type 2 diabetes remission after RYGB and 83.5% of individuals experiencing type 2 diabetes remission after VSG.

Among the 6,141 individuals who experienced type 2 diabetes remission, the subsequent type 2 diabetes relapse rate was lower for those who had RYGB than for those who had VSG (hazard ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.67–0.84]). Estimated relapse rates for those who had RYGB and VSG were 33.1% and 41.6%, respectively, at 5 years after surgery. At 5 years, compared with baseline, A1C was reduced, on average, 0.4 percentage points more for individuals who had RYGB than for individuals who had VSG (127).

Most notably, the Surgical Treatment and Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial, which randomized 150 participants with type 2 diabetes, A1C >7.0%, and BMI 27–43 kg/m2 to receive either metabolic surgery or medical treatment for type 2 diabetes using glucose-lowering agents, found that 29% of those treated with RYGB and 23% of those treated with VSG achieved A1C of #6.0% after 5 years (47). Available data suggest an erosion of diabetes remission over time (48); 35–50% of individuals...

Who initially achieve remission of diabetes eventually experience recurrence. Still, the median disease-free period among such individuals following RYGB is 8.3 years (128,129), and the majority of those who undergo surgery maintain substantial improvement of glycemia from baseline for at least 5–15 years (47,110,111,113).

Exceedingly few presurgical predictors of diabetes remission have been identified. However, younger age, shorter duration of diabetes (e.g., <8 years) (101), and lesser severity of diabetes (better glycemic management, not using insulin) are associated with higher rates of diabetes remission (47,111,130,131). Greater baseline visceral fat area may also predict diabetes remission, especially among Asian American people with type 2 diabetes (132).

A review of case series and reports suggests that metabolic surgery also improves the metabolic profiles and cardiovascular risk of people with type 1 diabetes, but larger and longer-term studies with better designs are needed to determine the role of metabolic surgery in such individuals (133).

Whereas metabolic surgery has greater initial costs than nonsurgical obesity treatments, retrospective analyses and modeling studies suggest that surgery may be cost-effective or even cost-saving for individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, these results largely depend on assumptions about the long-term effectiveness and safety of the procedures, the specific medications being compared, the time horizon for cost-effectiveness assessments, and the population examined (e.g., duration and severity of diabetes) (134,135).

The safety of metabolic surgery has improved significantly with continued refinement of minimally invasive (laparoscopic) approaches, enhanced training and credentialing, and involvement of interprofessional teams. Perioperative mortality rates are typically 0.1–0.5%, similar to those for common abdominal procedures such as cholecystectomy and hysterectomy (136,137). Major complications occur in 2–6% of those undergoing metabolic surgery, which compares favorably with the rates for other commonly performed elective operations (137). Post-surgical recovery times and morbidity have also dramatically declined. Minor complications and need for operative reinvention occur in up to 15% (136,138–143).

Beyond the perioperative period, longer-term risks include vitamin and mineral deficiencies, anemia, osteoporosis, dumping syndrome, and severe hypoglycemia (145). Nutritional and micronutrient deficiencies and related complications occur with variable frequency depending on the type of surgical procedure and require routine monitoring of micronutrient and nutritional status and lifelong vitamin/nutritional supplementation (145).

People who undergo metabolic surgery may be at increased risk for substance use, worsening or new-onset depression and/or anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation (150–154). Candidates for metabolic surgery should be assessed by a behavioral health professional with expertise in obesity management prior to consideration for surgery (155). Surgery should be postponed in individuals with alcohol or substance use disorders, severe depression, suicidal ideation, or other significant behavioral health conditions until these conditions have been sufficiently addressed.

Individuals with preoperative or new-onset psychopathology should be assessed regularly following surgery to optimize behavioral health and post-surgical outcomes.

Finally, no definitive evidence supports the pre– and post–metabolic surgery use of nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapeutics for chronic obesity. Existing studies suggest that among individuals with a BMI >50 kg/m2, GLP-1 RAs are associated with significant weight loss prior to surgery with no increase in complications or time to surgery (156). Nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapeutics can be considered as adjuvants after metabolic surgery to augment initial weight loss either shortly after surgery or when weight loss has plateaued (157). Studies have also shown that GLP-1 RAs can effectively treat weight regain after metabolic surgery and therefore could be considered as an alternative to revisional surgery (158). Long-term outcomes, however, are lacking in terms of durability of weight loss, effect on weight regain when medications are stopped, and long-term side effects.
