# 2. DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETES

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” includes the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, an interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system for ADA’s clinical practice recommendations and a full list of Professional Practice Committee members, please refer to Introduction and Methodology. Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.

Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders of carbohydrate metabolism in which glucose is both underutilized as an energy source and overproduced due to inappropriate gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, resulting in hyperglycemia (1). Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased A1C in the blood. Diabetes is classified conventionally into several clinical categories (e.g., type 1 or type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, and other specific types derived from other causes, such as monogenic diabetes, exocrine pancreatic disorders, and high-risk medications) (2).

# DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR DIABETES

Diabetes may be diagnosed based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria. Plasma glucose criteria include either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss) or hyperglycemic crises (i.e., diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] and/or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [HHS]) (Table 2.1).

# Recommendations

2.1a Diagnose diabetes based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria. Plasma glucose criteria include either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms/crises (Table 2.1). B

2.1b In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia (e.g., hyperglycemic crises), diagnosis requires confirmatory testing (Table 2.1). B

# Screening and Diagnosis of Diabetes

FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are appropriate for screening and diagnosis. It should be noted that detection rates of different screening tests vary in both.

# Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes

# Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

# Table 2.1—Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals

A1C ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay.*ORFPG ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h.*OR2-h PG ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT. The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.*ORIn an individual with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L). Random is any time of the day without regard to time since previous meal.

DCCT, Diabetes Control and Complications Trial; FPG, fasting plasma glucose; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; NGSP, National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program; WHO, World Health Organization; 2-h PG, 2-h plasma glucose. *In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnosis requires two abnormal results from different tests which may be obtained at the same time (e.g., A1C and FPG), or the same test at two different time points.

FPG, 2-h PG, and A1C reflect different aspects of glucose metabolism, and diagnostic cut points for the different tests will identify groups with incomplete concordance. Compared with FPG and A1C cut points, the 2-h PG value diagnoses more people with prediabetes and diabetes. Moreover, the efficacy of interventions for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated mainly among individuals with prediabetes who have impaired glucose tolerance with or without elevated fasting glucose, not for individuals with isolated impaired fasting glucose or for those with prediabetes defined by A1C criteria.

# Table 2.2—Criteria defining prediabetes in nonpregnant individuals

A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol)ORFPG 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) (IFG)OR2-h PG during 75-g OGTT 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L) (IGT)

For all three tests, risk is continuous, extending below the lower limit of the range and becoming disproportionately greater at the higher end of the range. FPG, fasting plasma glucose; IFG, impaired fasting glucose; IGT, impaired glucose tolerance; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; 2-h PG, 2-h plasma glucose.

Table 2.3—Considerations related to the use and interpretation of laboratory measurements of glucose and A1C

| | Glucose | A1C |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Cost | Inexpensive and available in most laboratories across the world | More expensive than glucose and not as widely available globally |
| Time frame of hyperglycemia | Acute measure | Chronic measure of glucose exposure over the past ~2–3 months |
| Preanalytic stability | Poor; plasma must be separated immediately or samples must be kept on ice to prevent glycolysis | Good |
| Sample | Measurement can vary depending on sample type (plasma, serum, whole blood) and source (capillary, venous, arterial) | Requires whole-blood sample |
| Assay standardization | Not standardized | Well standardized |
| Fasting | Fasting or timed samples required | Nonfasting test; no participant preparation is needed |
| Within-person variability | High | Low |
| Acute factors that can affect levels | Food intake, stress, recent illness, activity | Unaffected by recent food intake, stress, illness, activity |
| Other individual factors that can affect test results | Diurnal variation, medications, alcohol, smoking, bilirubin | Altered erythrocyte turnover (e.g., anemia, iron status, splenectomy, blood loss, transfusion, hemolysis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, erythropoietin), HIV, cirrhosis, renal failure, dialysis, pregnancy |
| Test interferences | Depends on specific assay: sample handling/ processing time, hemolysis, severe hypertriglyceridemia, severe hyperbilirubinemia | Depends on specific assay: hemoglobin variants, severe hypertriglyceridemia, severe hyperbilirubinemia |

traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay. B

2.2b Point-of-care A1C testing for diabetes screening and diagnosis should be restricted to devices approved for diagnosis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratories that perform testing of moderate complexity or higher by trained personnel. B

2.3 Evaluate for the possibility of a problem or interference with either test when there is consistent and substantial discordance between blood glucose values and A1C test results. B

2.4 In conditions associated with an altered relationship between A1C and glycemia, such as some hemoglobin variants, pregnancy (second and third trimesters and the postpartum period), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, HIV, hemodialysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, hemolysis, or erythropoietin therapy, plasma glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes. B

The A1C test should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) (ngsp.org) and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay. Outside the U.S., some assays are NGSP certified but many more are International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) certified (a similarly stringent process) (1).

Point-of-care A1C assays may be NGSP certified and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in monitoring glycemic management in people with diabetes in both Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–regulated and CLIA-waived settings. FDA-approved point-of-care A1C testing can be used in laboratories or sites that are CLIA certified, are inspected, and meet the CLIA quality standards. These standards include specified personnel requirements (including documented annual competency assessments) and participation three times per year in an approved proficiency testing program (15–18).

A1C has several advantages compared with FPG and OGTT, including greater convenience (fasting is not required), greater preanalytical stability, and fewer day-to-day perturbations during stress, changes in nutrition, or illness. However, it should be noted that there is lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point compared with that of 2-h PG as well as limited access in some parts of the world (Table 2.3).

A1C reflects glucose bound to hemoglobin over the life span of the erythrocyte (~120 days) and is thus a "weighted" average that is more heavily affected by recent blood glucose exposure. This means that clinically meaningful changes in A1C can be seen in <120 days. A1C is an indirect measure of glucose exposure, and factors that affect hemoglobin concentrations or erythrocyte turnover can affect A1C

(e.g., thalassemia or folate deficiency) If using samples at two different time points, it is recommended that the second test, which may be either a repeat of the initial test or a different test, be performed in a timely manner. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol), the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. Two different tests (such as A1C and FPG) both having results above the diagnostic threshold when collected at the same time or at two different time points would also confirm the diagnosis. On the other hand, if an individual has discordant results from two different tests, then the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, with careful consideration of factors that may affect measured A1C or glucose levels. The diagnosis is made based on the confirmatory screening test. For example, if an individual meets the diabetes criterion of A1C (two results ≥6.5% [≥48 mmol/mol]) but not FPG (<126 mg/dL [<7.0 mmol/L]), that person should nevertheless be considered to have diabetes.

# Types of Diabetes

1. Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune b-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults)
2. Type 2 diabetes (due to a nonautoimmune progressive loss of adequate b-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance)
3. Specific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes
4. Gestational diabetes mellitus (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior to gestation or other types of diabetes occurring throughout pregnancy, such as type 1 diabetes)

Type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous diseases in which clinical presentation and disease progression may vary considerably. Classification is important for determining personalized therapy, but some individuals cannot be clearly classified as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis. The traditional paradigms of type 2 diabetes having onset only in adults and type 1 diabetes having onset only in children are not accurate, as both diseases occur in all age groups. Children with type 1 diabetes often present with the hallmark symptoms of polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with DKA. The onset of type 1 diabetes may be more variable in adults; they may not present with the classic symptoms seen in children and may progress to insulin replacement more slowly.

# Confirming the Diagnosis

Unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis (e.g., individual with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis and random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL [≥11.1 mmol/L]), confirmation is necessary to establish the diagnosis. This can be accomplished by two abnormal screening test results, measured either at the same time or at two different time points.

# Recommendation

2.5 Classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management. Diabetes is classified conventionally into several clinical categories, although these are being reconsidered based on genetic, metabolomic, and other characteristics and pathophysiology.

Flowchart for investigation of suspected type 1 diabetes in newly diagnosed adults, based on data from White European populations

Figure 2.1—Flowchart for investigation of suspected type 1 diabetes in newly diagnosed adults, based on data from White European populations.

¹No single clinical feature confirms type 1 diabetes in isolation. ²Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) should be the primary antibody measured and, if negative, should be followed by islet tyrosine phosphatase 2 (IA-2) and/or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) where these tests are available. In individuals who have not been treated with insulin, antibodies against insulin may also be useful. In those diagnosed at <35 years of age who have no clinical features of type 2 diabetes or monogenic diabetes, a negative result does not change the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, since 5–10% of people with type 1 diabetes do not have antibodies. ³Monogenic diabetes is suggested by the presence of one or more of the following features: A1C <58 mmol/mol (<7.5%) at diagnosis, one parent with diabetes, features of a specific monogenic cause (e.g., renal cysts, partial lipodystrophy, maternally inherited deafness, and severe insulin resistance in the absence of obesity), and monogenic diabetes prediction model probability >5% (diabetesgenes.org/exeter-diabetes-app/ModyCalculator). ⁴A C-peptide test is only indicated in people receiving insulin treatment. A random sample (with concurrent glucose) within 5 h of eating can replace a formal C-peptide stimulation test in the context of classification. If the result is ≥600 pmol/L (≥1.8 ng/mL), the circumstances of testing do not matter. If the result is <600 pmol/L (<1.8 ng/mL) and the concurrent glucose is <4 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL) or the person may have been fasting, consider repeating the test. Results showing very low levels (e.g., <80 pmol/L [<0.24 ng/mL]) do not need to be repeated. Where a person is insulin treated, C-peptide must be measured prior to insulin discontinuation to exclude severe insulin deficiency. Do not test C-peptide within 2 weeks of a hyperglycemic emergency. ⁵Features of type 2 diabetes include increased BMI (≥25 kg/m²), absence of weight loss, absence of ketoacidosis, and less marked hyperglycemia. Less discriminatory features include non-White ethnicity, family history, longer duration and milder severity of symptoms prior to presentation, features of metabolic syndrome, and absence of a family history of autoimmunity. ⁶If genetic testing does not confirm monogenic diabetes, the classification is unclear and a clinical decision should be made about treatment. ⁷Type 2 diabetes should be strongly considered in older individuals. In some cases, investigation for pancreatic or other types of diabetes may be appropriate. ⁸A person with possible type 1 diabetes who is not treated with insulin will require careful monitoring and education so that insulin can be rapidly initiated in the event of glycemic deterioration. ⁹C-peptide values 200–600 pmol/L (0.6–1.8 ng/mL) are usually consistent with type 1 diabetes or maturity-onset diabetes of the young but may occur in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, particularly in people with normal or low BMI or after long duration. Reprinted and adapted from Holt et al. (36).

adults), who may present with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes (30). This form of diabetes is strongly inherited and is not HLA associated. An absolute requirement for insulin replacement therapy in affected individuals may be intermittent. It is important for health care professionals to realize that classification of diabetes type is not always straightforward at presentation

and that misdiagnosis is common and can occur in 40% of adults with new type 1 diabetes (e.g., adults with type 1 diabetes misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes). In comparison, individuals with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) may be misdiagnosed as having type 1 diabetes (36). Although difficulties in distinguishing diabetes type may occur in all age-groups at onset, the diagnosis generally becomes more obvious over time in people with b-cell deficiency as the degree of b-cell deficiency becomes clear (Fig. 2.1). One useful clinical tool for distinguishing diabetes type is the AABBCC approach: Age (e.g., for individuals <35 years old, consider type 1 diabetes); Autoimmunity (e.g., personal or family history of autoimmune disease or polyglandular autoimmune syndromes); Body habitus (e.g., BMI <25 kg/m2); Background (e.g., family history of type 1 diabetes); Control (preferred term is “goal,” i.e., the inability to achieve glycemic goals on noninsulin therapies); and Comorbidities (e.g., treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer can cause acute autoimmune type 1 diabetes) (36).

# TYPE 1 DIABETES

# Recommendations

In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, genetic and environmental factors can result in the progressive loss of b-cell mass and/or function that manifests clinically as hyperglycemia. Once hyperglycemia occurs, people with all forms of diabetes are at risk for developing the same chronic complications, although rates of progression may differ. The identification of individualized therapies for diabetes in the future will be informed by better characterization of the many paths to b-cell demise or dysfunction (38). Across the globe, many groups are working on combining clinical, pathophysiological, and genetic characteristics to more precisely define the subsets of diabetes that are currently clustered into the type 1 diabetes versus type 2 diabetes nomenclature with the goal of optimizing personalized treatment approaches (39). A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes does not preclude also having features classically associated with type 2 diabetes (e.g., insulin resistance, obesity, and other metabolic abnormalities), and until more precise subsets are used in clinical practice, it may be appropriate to categorize such an individual as having features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes to facilitate access to appropriate treatment.

# Screening and Autoantibody Testing

2.6 Screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes may be done by detection of autoantibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), islet antigen 2 (IA-2), or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8). B

2.7 Autoantibody-based screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes should be offered to those with a family history of type 1 diabetes or otherwise known elevated genetic risk. B

2.8 Having multiple confirmed islet autoantibodies is a risk factor for clinical diabetes. Testing for dysglycemia may be used to further forecast near-term risk (Table 2.4). When multiple islet autoantibodies are identified, referral to a specialized center for further evaluation and/or consideration of a clinical trial or approved therapy to potentially delay development of clinical diabetes should be considered. B

2.9 Standardized islet autoantibody tests are recommended for classification of diabetes in adults who have phenotypic risk factors that overlap with those for type 1 diabetes (e.g., younger age at diagnosis, unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, or short time to insulin treatment). E

Alternative additional stage 2 diagnostic criteria of 30-, 60-, or 90-min plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance test ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L) and confirmatory testing in those aged ≥18 years have been used in clinical trials (84). Dysglycemia can be defined by one or more criteria as outlined in the table.

autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic β-cells. Autoimmune markers include islet cell autoantibodies and autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) (such as GAD65), insulin, the tyrosine phosphatases islet antigen 2 (IA-2) and IA-2b, and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8). Numerous clinical studies are being conducted to test various methods of preventing or delaying type 1 diabetes in those with evidence of islet autoimmunity (trialnet.org/our-research/prevention-studies) (40–42, 47,53,54). The disease has strong HLA associations, with linkage to the DQB1 and DRB1 haplotypes, and genetic screening has been used in some research studies to identify high-risk populations. Specific alleles in these genes can be either predisposing (e.g., DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201 [DR3-DQ2] and DRB1*0401-DQB1*0302 [DR4-DQ8]) or protective (e.g., DRB1*1501 and DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602). Stage 1 of type 1 diabetes is defined by the presence of two or more of these autoantibodies and normoglycemia (Table 2.4). At stage 1, the 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes is ~44% overall but varies considerably based on number, titer, and specificity of autoantibodies as well as age of seroconversion and genetic risk (45). Stage 2 includes individuals with multiple islet autoantibodies and dysglycemia not yet diagnostic of diabetes (dysglycemia can be defined by one or more criteria as outlined in Table 2.4). At stage 2 of the disease, there is ~60% risk by 2 years and >75% risk within 5 years of developing a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (55,56). A consensus guidance provides expert recommendations on what should be monitored and how often these factors

should be monitored in individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes (57).

The rate of β-cell destruction is quite variable, being rapid in some individuals (particularly but not exclusively in infants and children) and slow in others (mainly but not exclusively adults) (44,58). Children and adolescents often present with DKA as the first manifestation of the disease, and rates in the U.S. have increased over the past 20 years (30–32). Others have modest fasting hyperglycemia that can rapidly change to severe hyperglycemia and/or DKA with infection or other stress. Adults may retain sufficient β-cell function to prevent DKA for many years; such individuals may have remission characterized by decreased insulin needs for months or years, eventually become dependent on insulin for survival, and are at risk for DKA (33–35, 59,60). At this later stage of the disease, there is little or no insulin secretion, as manifested by low or undetectable levels of plasma C-peptide. Immune-mediated diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in childhood and adolescence, but it can occur at any age. Autoimmune destruction of β-cells has multiple genetic factors and is also related to environmental factors that are still poorly defined. Although individuals did not classically have obesity when they presented with type 1 diabetes, obesity is increasingly common in the general population; as such, obesity should not preclude testing for type 1 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes are also prone to other autoimmune disorders, such as Hashi-moto thyroiditis, Graves disease, celiac

disease, Addison disease, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia (see Section 4, "Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities"). Type 1 diabetes can be associated with monogenic polyglandular autoimmune syndromes, including immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, which is an early-onset systemic autoimmune, genetic disorder caused by mutation of the forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) gene, and another disorder caused by the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene mutation (61,62).

Introduction of immunotherapy, specifically checkpoint inhibitors, for cancer treatment has led to unexpected adverse events, including immune system activation precipitating autoimmune disease. Fulminant onset of type 1 diabetes can occur, with DKA and low or undetectable levels of C-peptide as a marker of endogenous β-cell function (63–65). Fewer than half of these individuals have autoantibodies that are seen in type 1 diabetes, supporting alternate pathobiology. This immune-related adverse event occurs in just under 1% of checkpoint inhibitor–treated individuals but most commonly occurs with agents that block the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 pathway alone or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors (66). To date, the majority of immune checkpoint inhibitor–related cases of type 1 diabetes occur in people with high-risk HLA susceptibility haplotype for type 1 diabetes; however, people with either a neutral or typically protective

# Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

HLA haplotype for type 1 diabetes can also develop checkpoint inhibitor–associated type 1 diabetes (67). To date, risk cannot be predicted by family history or autoantibodies, so all health care professionals administering these medications or caring for people who have a history of current or past exposure to these agents should be mindful of this adverse effect and educate and monitor individuals appropriately.

A number of viruses have been associated with type 1 diabetes, including enteroviruses such as Coxsackievirus B. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, numbers of cases of hyperglycemia, DKA, and new diabetes increased, suggesting that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a trigger for or can unmask type 1 diabetes (68). Possible mechanisms of b-cell damage include virus-triggered b-cell death, immune-mediated loss of pancreatic b-cells, and damage to b-cells because of infection of surrounding exocrine cells. The cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 infection is a highly inflammatory state that could also contribute.

To better characterize and understand the pathogenesis of new-onset COVID-19–related diabetes, a global registry, CoviDIAB, has been established (69).

# PREDIABETES AND TYPE 2 DIABETES

# Recommendations

2.10 Screening for risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes with an assessment of risk factors or validated risk calculator should be done in asymptomatic adults. B

2.11a Testing for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age with overweight or obesity who have one or more risk factors (Table 2.5). B

2.11b For all other people, screening should begin at age 35 years. B

2.11c In people without prediabetes or diabetes after screening, repeat screening recommended at a minimum of 3-year intervals is reasonable, sooner with symptoms or change in risk (e.g., weight gain). C

2.12 To screen for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are each appropriate (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2). B

2.13 When using OGTT as a screening tool for prediabetes or diabetes, adequate carbohydrate intake (at least 150 g/day) should be assured for 3 days prior to testing. E

2.14 Risk-based screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or after 10 years of age, whichever comes first.

# Table 2.5—Criteria for screening for diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic adults

Prediabetes is the term used for individuals whose glucose or A1C levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes yet have abnormal carbohydrate metabolism that results in elevated glucose levels (dysglycemia) intermediate between normoglycemia and diabetes (28,85). People with prediabetes are defined by the presence of IFG and/or IGT and/or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) (Table 2.2). As prediabetes is an intermediate state between normoglycemia and diabetes, it is a significant risk factor for progression to diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease and several other cardiometabolic outcomes.

1. Testing should be considered in adults with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m2 or ≥23 kg/m2 in individuals of Asian ancestry) who have one or more of the following risk factors:
- First-degree relative with diabetes
- High-risk race, ethnicity, and ancestry (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American)
- History of cardiovascular disease
- Hypertension (≥130/80 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension)
- HDL cholesterol level <35 mg/dL (<0.9 mmol/L) and/or triglyceride level >250 mg/dL (>2.8 mmol/L)
- Individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome
- Physical inactivity
- Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease)
2. People with prediabetes (A1C ≥5.7% [≥39 mmol/mol], IGT, or IFG) should be tested yearly.
3. People who were diagnosed with GDM should have testing at least every 1–3 years.
4. For all other people, testing should begin at age 35 years.
5. If results are normal, testing should be repeated at a minimum of 3-year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results and risk status.
6. Individuals in other high-risk groups (e.g., people with HIV, exposure to high-risk medicines, evidence of periodontal disease, history of pancreatitis) should also be closely monitored.

GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; IFG, impaired fasting glucose; IGT, impaired glucose tolerance.

# Diagnosis of Prediabetes

IFG is defined as FPG levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL (from 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) (78,84) and IGT as 2-h PG levels during 75-g OGTT from 140 to 199 mg/dL (from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) (10). It should be noted that the World Health Organization and a number of diabetes organizations define the IFG lower limit at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L). The ADA also initially endorsed this IFG lower limit in 1997 (10). However, in 2003 the ADA adopted the new range of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) to better define IFG so that the population risk of developing diabetes with IFG would be similar to that with IGT (11).

As with the glucose measures, several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes demonstrated a strong, continuous curvilinear association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with A1C between 5.5% and 6.0% (between 37 and 42 mmol/mol) had a substantially increased risk of diabetes (5-year incidence from 9% to 25%). Those with an A1C range of 6.0–6.5% (42–48 mmol/mol) had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25% and 50% and a relative risk.

# Table 2.6—Risk-based screening for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic children and adolescents in a clinical setting

Screening should be considered in youth* who have overweight (≥85th percentile) or obesity (≥95th percentile) and who have one or more additional risk factors:

- Maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child’s gestation
- Family history of type 2 diabetes in first- or second-degree relative
- High-risk race, ethnicity, and ancestry (see Table 2.5)
- Signs of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome, large- or small-for-gestational-age birth weight)

GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus. *After the onset of puberty or after 10 years of age, whichever occurs earlier. If tests are normal, repeat testing at a minimum of 3-year intervals (or more frequently if BMI is increasing or risk factor profile is deteriorating) is recommended. Reports of type 2 diabetes before age 10 years exist, and this can be considered with numerous risk factors.

20 times higher than that with A1C of 5.0% (31 mmol/mol) (86). In a community-based study of African American and non-Hispanic White adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than fasting glucose (87). Other analyses suggest that A1C of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or higher is associated with a diabetes risk similar to that of the high-risk participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (88), and A1C at baseline was a strong predictor of the development of glucose-defined diabetes during the DPP and its follow-up (7).

An A1C range of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) identifies a group of individuals at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes. These individuals should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risks (see Section 3, “Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities”). Similar to glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is continuous and curvilinear: as A1C rises, the diabetes risk rises disproportionately (86). Aggressive interventions and vigilant follow-up should be pursued for those considered at very high risk (e.g., those with A1C >6.0% [>42 mmol/mol] and individuals with both IFG and IGT).

Table 2.5 outlines the criteria for screening for prediabetes. The ADA risk test is an additional option (i.e., an awareness tool for the layperson and the health care professional) for assessment to determine the appropriateness of screening for diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic adults (Fig. 2.2) (diabetes.org/diabetes-risk-test). For additional background regarding risk factors and screening for prediabetes, see screening and testing for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic adults and screening and testing for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, below. For details regarding individuals with prediabetes most likely to benefit from a formal behavioral or lifestyle intervention, see Section 3, “Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities.”

# Type 2 Diabetes

Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90–95% of all diabetes. This form encompasses individuals who generally have relative (rather than absolute) insulin deficiency and have insulin resistance (i.e., decreased biological responses to insulin). There are various causes of type 2 diabetes. Although the specific etiologies are not known, individuals do not have any of the other known causes of diabetes. Most, but not all, people with type 2 diabetes have overweight or obesity. Excess weight itself causes some degree of insulin resistance. Individuals who do not have obesity or overweight by traditional weight criteria may have an increased percentage of body fat distributed predominantly in the abdominal region, including sites involved in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and/or ectopic sites (e.g., skeletal muscle).

The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity (95,96). It occurs more frequently in individuals with prediabetes, prior gestational diabetes mellitus, or polycystic ovary syndrome. It is also more common in people with hypertension or dyslipidemia and in certain racial, ethnic, and ancestral subgroups (Table 2.5). It is often associated with a strong genetic predisposition or family history in first-degree relatives (more so than type 1 diabetes). However, the genetics of type 2 diabetes are poorly understood and under intense investigation in this era of precision medicine (50). The composition of the gut microbiome may also affect the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes (97).

In adults without traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes and/or of younger age, consider islet autoantibody testing (e.g., GAD autoantibodies) to exclude the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (36) (Fig. 2.1). HHS is more typically associated with type 2 diabetes (existing or new diagnosis) and is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolality, and dehydration in the absence of significant ketoacidosis. People with diabetes can also have mixed clinical features of both DKA and HHS (30).

Type 2 diabetes frequently goes undiagnosed for many years, because hyperglycemia develops gradually and, at earlier stages, is often not severe enough for the individual to notice the classic diabetes symptoms caused by hyperglycemia, such as dehydration or unintentional weight loss. Nevertheless, even undiagnosed people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications. There is often a long presymptomatic phase before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Simple tests to detect preclinical disease are readily available (98). The duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes. There are effective interventions that prevent progression from prediabetes to diabetes.

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

# People With HIV

People with HIV are at higher risk for developing prediabetes and diabetes. In addition, some antiretroviral (ARV) therapies may further increase the risk. Therefore, a screening protocol for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes is recommended. As the A1C test may underestimate glycemia in people with HIV, plasma glucose criteria are preferred to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes.

# Screening in Dental Practices

Because of the bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and diabetes, the utility of screening in a dental setting and referral to primary care as a means to improve the diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes has been explored. For example, one study estimated that 30% of individuals $30 years of age seen in general dental practices (including both people with and without periodontal disease) had newly diagnosed dysglycemia.

# Age

Age is a major risk factor for diabetes. Testing should begin at no later than age 35 years for all people. Screening should be considered in adults of any age with overweight or obesity and one or more risk factors for diabetes.

# Medications

Certain medications, such as glucocorticoids, statins, thiazide diuretics, some HIV medications, and second-generation antipsychotic medications, should be considered when deciding whether to screen for prediabetes or diabetes, as these medications are known to increase the risks of these conditions.

# Testing Interval

The appropriate interval between screening tests is not known. The rationale for the 3-year interval is that with this interval, the number of false-positive tests that require confirmatory testing will be reduced, and individuals with false-negative tests will be retested before substantial time elapses and complications develop. In especially high-risk individuals such as those with previous values nearer to the diabetes diagnostic cut point, shorter intervals between screenings may be useful.

# Community Screening

Ideally, screening should be carried out within a health care setting (including appropriately resourced pharmacies) because of the need for follow-up and treatment. Community screening outside a health care setting is generally not recommended because people with positive tests may not seek, or have access to, appropriate follow-up care.

# Pancreatic Diabetes or Diabetes in the Context of Disease of the Exocrine Pancreas

Additional information on type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents.

In the context of pancreatectomy, islet autotransplantation can be considered for selected individuals with medically refractory chronic pancreatitis in specialized centers to preserve endogenous islet function and insulin secretion. In some cases, autotransplant can lead to insulin independence. In others, it may decrease insulin requirements.

# Recommendations

- 2.17 Screen people for diabetes within 3–6 months following an episode of acute pancreatitis and annually thereafter. Screening for diabetes is recommended annually for people with chronic pancreatitis.

# Cystic Fibrosis–Related Diabetes

# Recommendations

- 2.18 Annual screening for cystic fibrosis–related diabetes (CFRD) with an OGTT should begin by age 10 years in all people with cystic fibrosis not previously diagnosed with CFRD.
- 2.19 A1C is not recommended as a screening test for CFRD due to low sensitivity. However, a value of $6.5% ($48 mmol/mol) is consistent with a diagnosis of CFRD and reduces patient screening burden.
- 2.20 Beginning 5 years after the diagnosis of CFRD, annual monitoring for complications of diabetes is recommended.

Pancreatic diabetes (also termed pancreatogenic diabetes or type 3c diabetes) includes both structural (e.g., destruction or removal of normal pancreatic tissue) and functional loss of glucose-normalizing insulin secretion in the context of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and is commonly misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes. The diverse set of etiologies includes pancreatitis (acute and chronic pancreatic inflammation and associated fibrosis leading to loss of functional exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function), trauma or pancreatectomy, neoplasia, cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis, fibrocalculous pancreatopathy, rare genetic disorders, and idiopathic forms; as such, pancreatic diabetes is the preferred umbrella term.

Acute (even a single bout) and chronic pancreatitis can lead to postpancreatitis diabetes mellitus. A distinguishing feature is concurrent pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (consider screening individuals with acute and chronic pancreatitis for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency by measuring fecal elastase), pathological pancreatic imaging (endoscopic ultrasound, MRI, and computed tomography), and absence of type 1 diabetes–associated autoimmunity. There is loss of both insulin and glucagon secretion and often higher-than-expected insulin requirements. Risk for microvascular complications appears to be similar to that of other forms of diabetes.

For people with pancreatitis and diabetes, therapy should be advanced if A1C goals are not met. Glucose-lowering therapies potentially associated with increased risk of pancreatitis (i.e., incretin-based therapies) should be avoided. Early initiation of insulin therapy should be considered.

Milder abnormalities of glucose tolerance are even more common and occur at earlier ages than CFRD. Whether individuals with IGT should be treated with insulin replacement has not currently been determined. Although screening for CFRD mortality has significantly decreased over time, the gap in mortality between people with cystic fibrosis with and without diabetes has considerably narrowed.

Additional resources for the clinical management of CFRD can be found in the position statement “Clinical Care Guidelines for Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes” and in the International Society for Pediatric Endocrinology.

# POSTTRANSPLANTATION DIABETES MELLITUS

# Recommendations

2.21 After organ transplantation, screening for hyperglycemia should be done. A formal diagnosis of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is best made once the individual is stable on an immunosuppressive plan and in the absence of an acute infection.

2.22 The OGTT is the preferred test to make a diagnosis of PTDM.

2.23 Immunosuppressive plans shown to provide the best outcomes for individuals and graft survival should be used, irrespective of PTDM risk.

Several terms are used in the literature to describe the presence of diabetes following organ transplantation. New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is one such designation that describes individuals who develop new-onset diabetes following transplant. NODAT excludes people with pretransplant diabetes that was undiagnosed as well as posttransplant hyperglycemia that resolves by the time of discharge. Another term, posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM), describes the presence of diabetes in the post-transplant setting irrespective of the timing of diabetes onset. The clinical importance of PTDM lies in its impact as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease in solid-organ transplantation.

Hyperglycemia is very common during the early posttransplant period, with 90% of kidney allograft recipients exhibiting hyperglycemia in the first few weeks following transplant. In most cases, such stress- or steroid-induced hyperglycemia resolves by the time of discharge. Although the use of immunosuppressive therapies is a major contributor to the development of PTDM, the risks of transplant rejection outweigh the risks of PTDM, and the role of the diabetes health care professional is to treat hyperglycemia appropriately regardless of the type of immunosuppression. Risk factors for PTDM include both general diabetes risks (such as age, family history of diabetes, and obesity) and transplant-specific factors, such as use of immunosuppressant agents.

# Diagnosis of Monogenic Diabetes

The diagnosis of monogenic diabetes should be considered in children and adults diagnosed with diabetes in early adulthood with the following findings:

- Diabetes diagnosed within the first 6 months of life
- Diabetes without typical features of type 1 or type 2 diabetes (negative diabetes-associated autoantibodies, no obesity, and lacking other metabolic features, especially strong family history of diabetes)
- Stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia (100–150 mg/dL [5.6–8.5 mmol/L]), stable A1C between 5.6% and 7.6% (between 38 and 60 mmol/mol), especially if no obesity

# Neonatal Diabetes

Diabetes occurring under 6 months of age is termed neonatal diabetes, and about 80–85% of cases can be found to have an underlying monogenic cause. Neonatal diabetes occurs much less often after 6 months of age, whereas autoimmune type 1 diabetes rarely occurs before 6 months of age. Neonatal diabetes can either be transient or permanent. Transient diabetes is most often due to overexpression of genes on chromosome 6q24, is recurrent in about half of cases, and may be treatable with medications other than insulin. Permanent neonatal diabetes is most commonly due to autosomal dominant mutations in the genes encoding the Kir6.2 subunit and SUR1 subunit of the b-cell KATP channel.

The ADA-European Association for the Study of Diabetes type 1 diabetes consensus report recommends that regardless of current age, individuals diagnosed under 6 months of age should have genetic testing (36). Correct diagnosis has critical implications, because 30–50% of people with KATP-related neonatal diabetes will exhibit improved blood glucose levels when treated with high-dose oral sulfonylureas instead of insulin. Insulin gene (INS) mutations are the second most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes, with insulin therapy being the preferred treatment strategy.

Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young

MODY is frequently characterized by onset of hyperglycemia at an early age (classically before age 25 years, although diagnosis may occur at older ages). MODY is characterized by impaired insulin secretion with minimal or no defects in insulin action (in the absence of coexistent obesity). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with abnormalities in at least 14 genes on different chromosomes identified to date (152). The most commonly reported forms are GCK-MODY (MODY2), HNF1A-MODY (MODY3), and HNF4A-MODY (MODY1).

Correct diagnosis of monogenic forms of diabetes is critical because people who have them may be incorrectly diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to suboptimal, even potentially harmful, treatment plans and delays in diagnosing other family members (152). A diagnosis of MODY should be considered in individuals who have atypical diabetes and multiple family members with diabetes not characteristic of type 1 or type 2 diabetes (155–162) (Fig. 2.1). In most cases, the presence of autoantibodies for type 1 diabetes precludes further testing for monogenic diabetes, but the presence of autoantibodies in people with monogenic diabetes has been reported. Individuals in whom monogenic diabetes is suspected should have genetic testing. Genetic screening (i.e., next-generation sequencing) is increasingly available and cost-effective (152). Consultation with a center specializing in diabetes genetics is recommended to understand the significance of genetic mutations and how best to approach further evaluation, treatment, and genetic counseling. Genetic counseling is recommended to ensure that affected individuals understand the patterns of inheritance and the importance of a correct diagnosis and to address comprehensive cardiovascular risk.

A diagnosis of one of the three most common forms of MODY, HNF1A-MODY, GCK-MODY, and HNF4A-MODY, allows for more cost-effective personalized therapy (i.e., no therapy for GCK-MODY and sulfonylureas as first-line therapy for HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY). See Section 9, "Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic

2.25 In individuals who are planning pregnancy, screen those with risk factors (Table 2.5) B and consider testing all individuals of childbearing potential for undiagnosed prediabetes or diabetes. E

2.26a Before 15 weeks of gestation, test individuals with risk factors (Table 2.5) B and consider testing all individuals E for undiagnosed diabetes at the first prenatal visit using standard diagnostic criteria if not screened preconception.

2.26b Before 15 weeks of gestation, screen for abnormal glucose metabolism to identify individuals who are at higher risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, are more likely to need insulin, and are at high risk of a later gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosis. B

2.26c Screen for early abnormal glucose metabolism with dysglycemia using FPG 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) or A1C 5.9–6.4% (41–47 mmol/mol). B

2.27 Screen for GDM at 24–28 weeks of gestation in pregnant individuals not previously found to have diabetes or high-risk abnormal glucose metabolism detected earlier in the current pregnancy. A

2.28 Screen individuals with GDM for prediabetes or diabetes at 4–12 weeks postpartum, using the 75-g OGTT and clinically appropriate nonpregnancy diagnostic criteria. B

2.29 Individuals with a history of GDM should have lifelong screening for the development of prediabetes or diabetes every 1–3 years. B

# Definition

For many years, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was defined as any degree of glucose intolerance that was first recognized during pregnancy (86), regardless of the degree of hyperglycemia. This definition facilitated a uniform strategy for detection and classification of GDM, but this definition has limitations (163).

First, the best evidence reveals that many cases of GDM represent preexisting hyperglycemia that is detected by routine screening in pregnancy, as routine screening is not widely performed in nonpregnant individuals of reproductive age. The ongoing epidemic of obesity and diabetes has led to more type 2 diabetes in people of reproductive age, with an increase in the number of pregnant individuals with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in early pregnancy (164–166).

Ideally, undiagnosed diabetes should be identified preconception in individuals with risk factors or in high-risk populations (167–172), as they are likely to benefit from preconception care. The preconception care of people with known preexisting diabetes results in lower A1C and reduced risk of birth defects, preterm delivery, perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational-age birth weight, and neonatal intensive care unit admission (173).

If individuals are not screened prior to pregnancy, universal early screening at <15 weeks of gestation for undiagnosed diabetes may be considered over selective screening (Table 2.5), particularly in populations with high prevalence of risk factors and undiagnosed diabetes in people of childbearing age.

Strong racial and ethnic disparities exist in the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Therefore, early screening provides an initial step to identify these health disparities so that they can begin to address them (169–172).

Diagnostic criteria for identifying undiagnosed diabetes in early pregnancy are the same as those used in nonpregnant individuals (Table 2.1). Individuals found to have diabetes should be classified as having diabetes complicating pregnancy (most often type 2 diabetes, rarely type 1 diabetes or monogenic diabetes) and managed accordingly.

Early abnormal glucose metabolism, defined as a fasting glucose threshold of <110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) or an A1C of <5.9% (41 mmol/mol), may identify individuals who are at higher risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (pre-eclampsia, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, and perinatal death), are at high risk of a later GDM diagnosis, and are more likely to need insulin treatment (174–176).

An A1C threshold of 5.7% (39 mmol/L) has not been shown to be associated with adverse perinatal outcomes (177,178).

Both the FPG and A1C are low-cost tests. An advantage of the A1C test is its convenience, as it can be added to the prenatal laboratories and does not require an early-morning fasting appointment. Disadvantages include inaccuracies in the presence of increased red blood cell turnover and hemoglobinopathies (usually reads lower) and higher values with anemia and reduced red blood cell turnover (181). A1C is not reliable for screening for GDM or for preexisting diabetes at 15 weeks of gestation or later in part from the higher red blood cell turnover in pregnancy but also from the unknown diabetes status prior to pregnancy, which could help distinguish new-onset diabetes from preexisting diabetes.

GDM is often indicative of underlying β-cell dysfunction (182), which confers marked increased risk for later development of glucose intolerance and diabetes in the mother after delivery (183–185). As effective prevention interventions are available (186,187), individuals diagnosed with GDM should receive lifelong screening for prediabetes to allow interventions to reduce diabetes risk and for type 2 diabetes to allow treatment at the earliest possible time (188).

## Diagnosis

GDM carries risks for the mother, fetus, and neonate. The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study (189), a large-scale multinational cohort study completed by more than 23,000 pregnant individuals, demonstrated that risk of adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes continuously increased as a function of maternal glycemia at 24–28 weeks of gestation, even within ranges previously considered normal for pregnancy. For most complications, there was no threshold for risk. These results have led to careful reconsideration of the diagnostic criteria for GDM.

GDM diagnosis (Table 2.8) can be accomplished with either of two strategies:

1. The "one-step" 75-g OGTT derived from the IADPSG criteria, or
2. The older "two-step" approach with a 50-g (nonfasting) screen followed by a 100-g OGTT for those who screen positive based on the work of Carpenter-Coustan's interpretation of the older O'Sullivan and Mahan (190) criteria.

### Table 2.8—Screening for and diagnosis of GDM

#### One-step strategy
Perform a 75-g OGTT, with plasma glucose measurement when an individual is fasting and at 1 and 2 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes.
The OGTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 h.
The diagnosis of GDM is made when any of the following plasma glucose values are met or exceeded:
- Fasting: 92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L)
- 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
- 2 h: 153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L)

#### Two-step strategy
Step 1: Perform a 50-g GLT (nonfasting), with plasma glucose measurement at 1 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes.
If the plasma glucose level measured 1 h after the load is ≥130, 135, or 140 mg/dL (7.2, 7.5, or 7.8 mmol/L, respectively),* proceed to a 100-g OGTT.
Step 2: The 100-g OGTT should be performed when the individual is fasting.
The diagnosis of GDM is made when at least two† of the following four plasma glucose levels (measured fasting and at 1, 2, and 3 h during OGTT) are met or exceeded (Carpenter-Coustan criteria [208]):
- Fasting: 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L)
- 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
- 2 h: 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L)
- 3 h: 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)

GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; GLT, glucose load test; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test. *American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends any of the commonly used thresholds of 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL for the 1-h 50-g GLT (204). †ACOG notes that one elevated value can be used for diagnosis (204).

Different diagnostic criteria will identify different degrees of maternal hyperglycemia and maternal/fetal risk, leading experts to debate optimal strategies for the diagnosis of GDM.

### One-Step Strategy

The IADPSG examined data from the HAPO study and defined diagnostic cut points for GDM as the average fasting, 1-h, and 2-h PG values during a 75-g OGTT in individuals at 24–28 weeks of gestation, wherein the cut points were those at which odds for adverse outcomes reached 1.75 times the estimated odds. This one-step strategy was anticipated to significantly increase the incidence of GDM (from 5–6% to 15–20%), primarily because only one abnormal value, not two, became sufficient to make the diagnosis (191). Many regional studies have seen a roughly one- to threefold increase in GDM cases using the IADPSG criteria (192). A study of pregnancy OGTTs with glucose levels blinded to caregivers found that 11 years after their pregnancies, individuals who would have been diagnosed with GDM by the one-step approach, as compared with those without GDM, were at 3.4-fold higher risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and had children with a higher risk of obesity and increased body fat, suggesting that the group identified as having GDM by the one-step approach would benefit from the increased screening for diabetes and prediabetes after pregnancy (193). The ADA recommends the IADPSG diagnostic criteria to optimize gestational outcomes, because these criteria are the only ones based on pregnancy outcomes rather than end points such as prediction of subsequent maternal diabetes.

Expected benefits of using IADPSG criteria for offspring are inferred from intervention trials focusing on individuals with lower levels of hyperglycemia than those identified using older GDM diagnostic criteria. Those trials found modest benefits, including reduced rates of large-for-gestational-age births and preeclampsia (194,195). Of note, 80–90% of participants being treated for mild GDM in these two randomized controlled trials could be managed with lifestyle therapy alone. The OGTT glucose cutoffs in these two trials overlapped the thresholds recommended by the IADPSG, and in one trial (195), the 2-h PG threshold (140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/L]) was lower than the cutoff recommended by the IADPSG (153 mg/dL [8.5 mmol/L]).

Different criteria have been published to date. However, a randomized trial of testing for GDM at 24–28 weeks of gestation by the one-step method using IADPSG criteria versus the two-step method by Carpenter-Coustan criteria identified twice as many individuals with GDM using the one-step method. Despite treating more individuals for GDM using the one-step method, there was no difference in pregnancy and perinatal complications, though concerns were raised about sample size estimates and unanticipated suboptimal engagement with the screening and treatment protocol. For example, in the two-step group, 165 participants not counted as having GDM were treated for isolated elevated FPG >95 mg/dL (>5.3 mmol/L).

The one-step method identifies long-term risks of maternal prediabetes and diabetes as well as offspring glucose intolerance and adiposity. Post hoc GDM in individuals diagnosed with this method in the HAPO cohort was associated with higher prevalence of IGT; higher 30-min, 1-h, and 2-h glucose levels during the OGTT; and reduced insulin sensitivity and oral disposition index in their offspring at 10–14 years of age compared with offspring of mothers without GDM. Associations of mother’s fasting, 1-h, and 2-h values on the 75-g OGTT were continuous with a comprehensive panel of offspring metabolic outcomes. HAPO Follow-up Study (HAPO FUS) data demonstrate that neonatal adiposity and fetal hyperinsulinemia (cord C-peptide), both higher across the continuum of maternal hyperglycemia, are mediators of childhood body fat.

Data are lacking on how the treatment of mother’s hyperglycemia in pregnancy affects her offspring’s risk for obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. Additional well-designed clinical studies are needed to determine the optimal intensity of monitoring and treatment of individuals with GDM diagnosed by the one-step strategy.

# Future Considerations

Data exist to support each strategy, as demonstrated by conflicting recommendations by expert groups. A systematic review of economic evaluations of GDM screening found that the one-step method identified more cases of GDM and was more likely to be cost-effective than the two-step method. The decision of which strategy to implement must therefore be made based on the relative values placed on factors that have yet to be measured (e.g., willingness to change practice based on correlation studies rather than intervention trial results, available infrastructure, and importance of cost considerations).

The IADPSG criteria (one-step strategy) have been adopted internationally as the preferred approach. Data that compare population-wide outcomes with one-step versus two-step approaches have been inconsistent to date. Pregnancies complicated by GDM per the IADPSG criteria, but not recognized as such, have outcomes comparable to pregnancies with diagnosed GDM by the more stringent two-step criteria. There remains strong consensus that establishing a uniform approach to diagnosing GDM will benefit people with GDM, caregivers, and policymakers. Longer-term outcome studies are currently underway.

# Two-Step Strategy

In 2013, the NIH convened a consensus development conference to consider diagnostic criteria for diagnosing GDM. The 15-member panel had representatives from obstetrics and gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, pediatrics, diabetes research, biostatistics, and other related fields. The panel recommended continuing a two-step approach to screening that used a 1-h 50-g glucose loading test (GLT) followed by a 3-h 100-g OGTT for those who screened positive. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends any of the commonly used thresholds of 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL for the 1-h 50-g GLT.
