The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” includes the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, an interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system for ADA’s clinical practice recommendations and a full list of Professional Practice Committee members, please refer to Introduction and Methodology. Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.

Building positive health behaviors and maintaining psychological well-being are foundational for achieving diabetes management goals and maximizing quality of life (1,2). Essential to achieving these goals are diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES), medical nutrition therapy (MNT), routine physical activity, adequate quality sleep, support for cessation of tobacco products and vaping, health behavior counseling, and psychosocial care. Following an initial comprehensive health evaluation (see Section 4, “Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities”), health care professionals should engage in person-centered collaborative care with people with diabetes (3–6). Person-centered collaborative care is guided by shared decision-making in treatment plan selection; facilitating access to medical, behavioral, psychosocial, and technological resources and support; and shared monitoring of agreed-upon diabetes care plans and behavioral goals (7,8). Routine care evaluations should include assessments of medical and behavioral health outcomes, particularly during periods of changes in health and well-being.

# DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION AND SUPPORT

# Recommendations

5.1 All people with diabetes should be advised to participate in developmentally and culturally appropriate diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) to facilitate informed decision-making, self-care behaviors, problem-solving, and active collaboration with the health care team.

5.2 Provide DSMES at diagnosis, annually and/or when not meeting treatment goals, when complicating factors develop (e.g., medical, functional, and psychosocial), and when transitions in life and care occur.

# Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being

# 5.3 Routinely assess clinical outcomes, health status, and well-being as key goals of DSMES.

Education and skill-building program (10) showed that addressing these aims improved health outcomes in a population in need of health care resources. Furthermore, following a DSMES curriculum improves quality of care (11).

# 5.4 Screen for behavioral health concerns at the same critical times as evaluating the need for DSMES

Refer to a qualified behavioral health professional if indicated to increase engagement in DSMES.

# 5.5 DSMES should be culturally appropriate and responsive to individual preferences, needs, and values

Such education and support should be documented and made available to members of the entire diabetes care team. A DSMES may be offered in group or individual settings.

# 5.6 Consider offering DSMES via telehealth and/or digital interventions

As needed to meet individual preferences, address barriers to access, and improve satisfaction. In accordance with the “2022 National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support” (here referred to as the National Standards for DSMES) (9), all people with diabetes should participate in developmentally appropriate and culturally sensitive DSMES, as it helps people with diabetes identify and implement effective self-management strategies (16,17).

# 5.7 DSMES can improve outcomes and reduce costs

So reimbursement by third-party payors is recommended. DSMES is associated with improved diabetes knowledge and self-care behaviors (16,17), lower A1C (16–21), lower self-reported weight (22), improved quality of life (23,24), reduced all-cause mortality risk (25), positive coping behaviors (5,26), and lower health care costs (27–29).

# 5.8 Identify and address barriers to DSMES

That exist at the payor, health system, clinic, health care professional, and individual levels. DSMES should be thought of as an ongoing process—not a one-time occurrence.

# 5.9 Screen for and include social determinants of health in guiding design and delivery of DSMES

With the ultimate goal of health equity across all populations. The overall objectives of DSMES are to support informed decision-making, self-care behaviors, problem-solving, and active collaboration with the health care team to improve clinical outcomes, health status, and well-being in a cost-effective manner (2).

# Evidence for the Benefits

DSMES services facilitate the knowledge, decision-making, and skills mastery necessary for optimal diabetes self-care and incorporate the needs, goals, and life experiences of the person with diabetes (9). When providing DSMES, health care professionals should consider the individual’s burden of treatment, level of self-efficacy for self-care behaviors, and degree of social and family support.

# Additional Critical Time Points for DSMES Evaluation

Engagement in self-management behaviors and subsequent clinical outcomes, health status, and quality of life, in addition to psychosocial factors affecting the person’s ability to self-manage, should be monitored routinely. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated a decision-making process indicated that there are additional critical time points when the need for DSMES should be evaluated by the health care professional and/or interprofessional team, with referrals made as needed (2):

- Annually and/or when not meeting treatment goals, whichever is more frequent.

Strong evidence now exists for the benefits of telehealth, telemedicine, and telephone-based or internet-based (i.e., virtual) DSMES for diabetes prevention and management in a wide variety of populations and age-groups (9,41–44). When feasible, the best choice for delivery of DSMES is that which will align with individual preferences.

Review and meta-analysis of RCTs reported moderate evidence indicating digital health technologies (e.g., mobile apps, websites, digital coaching, and SMS [i.e., texting]) can be effective modes of intervention delivery for DSMES. In fact, telehealth-based interventions have been found to produce a greater reduction in A1C (0.30 percentage points; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.19) compared with control. These digital methods provide outcomes that are comparable to or even better than those seen with traditional in-person care. Greater A1C reductions are demonstrated with increased engagement, although data from trials are heterogeneous.

Diabetes care and education specialists (DCES) are effective providers of DSMES. Members of the DSMES team can include a variety of health care professionals such as nurses (registered nurses and nurse practitioners), registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs), pharmacists, social workers, certified health education specialists, exercise physiologists, care coordinators or navigators, and others who can tailor curricula to individual needs. Team members acting in the DCES capacity should have specialized clinical knowledge of diabetes and behavior change principles. In addition, a DCES needs to be knowledgeable about technology-enabled services and may serve as a technology champion within their practice.

Credentialing such as certified diabetes care and education specialists (CDCES) and/or board certification in advanced diabetes management (BC-ADM) demonstrates an individual’s specialized training in and understanding of diabetes management and support, and engagement with qualified professionals has been shown to improve diabetes-related outcomes. There is also continued and growing evidence for the role of community health workers, peer educators, peer support, and lay leaders in providing ongoing diabetes self-management support.

Social determinants of health (SDOH) are an important aspect of diabetes care and should always be weighed in guiding the design and delivery of DSMES. The DSMES team should consider demographic characteristics such as racial identity, ethnic and cultural background, biological sex and gender identity, age, geographic location, technology access, education, literacy, and numeracy.

Barriers to equitable DSMES access can be mitigated by keeping in mind the SDOH and leveraging creative delivery options (e.g., telehealth and online) that will work best for the population in need of DSMES. Despite the recognized benefits of DSMES, only about half of individuals eligible for DSMES through their health insurance receive it. Barriers to DSMES exist at multiple levels including the health system, payor, clinic, health care professional, and individual for a myriad of reasons from lack of administrative leadership support to ineffective DSMES referral processes and transportation challenges.

Low participation can be due to lack of referrals, logistical issues (e.g., accessibility, timing, and costs), and lack of a perceived benefit. Thus, in addition to educating referring health care professionals about the benefits of DSMES and the critical times to refer, efforts to identify and address potential barriers at all levels need to be made. This was illustrated in a multilevel diabetes care intervention that combined clinical outreach, standardized protocols, and DSMES with SDOH screening and referrals to social needs support; a 15% increase in receipt of DSMES, including among people on Medicaid, was documented.

# Diabetes Technologies

Technology-enabled diabetes self-management solutions (e.g., continuous glucose monitors [CGM], closed-loop pump systems, and connected glucose meters) improve A1C most effectively when there is two-way communication between the person with diabetes and the health care team, individualized feedback, use of person-generated health data, and education. When combined with individualized DSMES or behavioral interventions, CGM demonstrated greater improvement of glycemic and psychosocial outcomes than CGM alone. Similarly, DSMES plus intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) demonstrated increased time in range (70–180 mg/dL [3.9–10.0 mmol/L]), less time above range, and greater reduction in A1C compared with DSMES alone.

Incorporating a systematic approach for technology assessment, adoption, and integration into the diabetes care plan could help ensure equity in access and standardized application of technology-enabled solutions.

# Reimbursement

Medicare reimburses DSMES (referred to as diabetes self-management training [DSMT] by Medicare) when the service is in accordance with the National Standards for DSMES and is recognized by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) through the Education Recognition Program or by the Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists.

DSMES is also covered by most other health insurance plans. Ongoing support has been shown to be instrumental for improving outcomes when it is implemented after the completion of formal DSMES. For comprehensive information about Medicare reimbursement, readers may find the following website useful: www.cdc.gov/diabetes-toolkit/php/reimbursement/medicare-reimbursement-guidelines.html. In brief, the Medicare Part B initial DSMT is a “once-in-a-lifetime” benefit. Individual encounters are reimbursable for the first 10 h (1 h of individual training and 9 h of group training). Two hours of follow-up DSMT are allowed each year after the initial DSMT. If a person has special needs that would interfere with effective group participation, these should be identified on the referral order. For Medicaid, DSMES coverage varies by state, but further guidance can be found at www.cdc.gov/diabetes-toolkit/php/reimbursement/medicare-reimbursement-guidelines.html. Additional information addressing implementation of a successful DSMES program can be found in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention DSMES toolkit at www.cdc.gov/diabetes-toolkit/php/index.html.

# MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY

When the first ADA Standards of Care guidelines were published in 1989, nutrition was only mentioned in two sentences of the entire 4-page document. Even today, the science of nutrition for diabetes continues to evolve. There has also been a change in how we talk about nutrition. We are moving away from emphasizing macronutrients, which include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and micronutrients, which include vitamins and minerals, and instead focusing on foods. More broadly, we are encouraging people to think in terms of eating patterns, also known as dietary patterns or food patterns, or the totality of the foods and beverages a person consumes. Additionally, promoting nutrient-dense food choices, defined as foods high in micronutrients while being relatively low in calories (e.g., vegetables, fruits, and legumes), is useful. This integrative food-based approach aligns with the 2021 American Heart Association dietary guidance to improve cardiovascular health, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and ADA type 1 consensus report and type 2 consensus report, and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025.

Simply put, people eat food, not nutrients, and nutrition recommendations need to be applicable to what people actually eat. Additionally, macronutrients are not interchangeable entities and vary by nutrient type and quality. As an example, carbohydrates include legumes, whole grains, and fruits, which are in the same category as refined grains, but their health effects are quite different.

MNT is effective and beneficial to people with diabetes. When delivered by an RDN, MNT is associated with A1C absolute decreases of 1.0–1.9% for people with type 1 diabetes and 0.3–2.0% for people with type 2 diabetes. Because type 2 diabetes is progressive, behavior modification alone may not be adequate to maintain euglycemia over time. However, after pharmacotherapy is initiated, nutrition therapy continues to be an important component of ongoing diabetes self-management, and RDNs providing diabetes-specific MNT should assess and monitor medication changes in relation to the nutrition care plan.

All members of the health care team should also be empowered to reiterate the general and evidence-based nutrition advice to limit processed foods and foods high in added salt, sugars, and fats and, when possible, choose whole foods. For more detailed information on nutrition therapy, please refer to the ADA consensus report on nutrition therapy. Contained in the report is an important and often repeated tenet, i.e., there is no one-size-fits-all eating pattern for individuals with diabetes, and meal planning should be individualized. Nutrition therapy plays an integral role in overall diabetes management, and each person with diabetes should actively engage in education, self-management, and treatment planning with the health care team and participate in collaborative development of an individualized eating plan.

# Eating Patterns and Meal Planning

| **Encourage healthy, evidence-based eating patterns** |
| 5.13 For diabetes prevention and management of people with prediabetes or diabetes, recommend individualized meal plans that keep nutrient quality, total calories, and metabolic goals in mind, B as data do not support a specific macronutrient pattern. |
| 5.14 Eating patterns should emphasize key nutrition principles (inclusion of nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, lean proteins, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and low-fat dairy or nondairy alternatives) and minimize consumption of red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, refined grains, processed and ultraprocessed foods in people with prediabetes and diabetes. B |
| 5.15 Consider reducing overall carbohydrate intake for adults with diabetes to improve glycemia, as this approach may be applied to a variety of eating patterns that meet individual needs and preferences. B |
| **Do not promote the use of micronutrient, herbal, and other supplements to aid in glycemic management** |
| 5.16 Health care professionals should inquire about intake of dietary supplements and counsel as necessary. Supplementation with micronutrients (e.g., vitamins and minerals, such as magnesium or chromium) or herbs or spices (e.g., cinnamon and aloe vera) for glycemic benefits is not recommended. C |
| 5.17 Counsel against β-carotene supplementation, as there is evidence of harm for certain individuals and it confers no benefit. B |
| **Avoid excess alcohol intake** |
| 5.18 Advise adults with diabetes and those at risk for diabetes who consume alcohol to not exceed the recommended daily limits. B Advise abstainers to not start drinking alcohol, even in moderation. |
| 5.19 Educate people with diabetes about the signs, symptoms, and self-management of delayed hypoglycemia after drinking alcohol, especially when using insulin or insulin secretagogues. The importance of monitoring glucose after drinking alcoholic beverages to reduce hypoglycemia risk should be emphasized. B |
| **Limit sodium and foods high in salt** |
| 5.20 Counsel people with diabetes to limit sodium consumption to <2,300 mg/day, as clinically appropriate, B and that the best way to achieve this is through limiting consumption of processed foods. B |
| **Recommend water over other beverages** |
| 5.21 Counsel people with prediabetes and diabetes that water is recommended over nutritive and nonnutritive sweetened beverages. A |

| **Screen for malnutrition** |
| 5.23 Screen people with diabetes and those at risk for diabetes for malnutrition, especially those who have undergone metabolic surgery A and those being treated with weight loss pharmacologic therapies. B |

eating plans, and approaches are terms that are often used interchangeably, but they are different and relevant in individualizing nutrition care plans (84).

- Eating pattern, dietary pattern, or food pattern. The totality of all foods and beverages consumed over a given period of time. An eating pattern can be ascribed to an individual, but it is also the term used in prospective cohort and observational nutrition studies to classify and study nutrition patterns. Examples of eating patterns include Mediterranean style, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), low carbohydrate, vegetarian, and plant based (84).
- Eating/meal plan (historically referred to as a diet). An individualized guide to plan when, what, and how much to eat on a daily basis, completed by the person with diabetes and the RDN. The eating plan could incorporate an eating pattern combined with a strategy or method to direct some of the choices. Eating plans are based on the individual's usual eating style and food preferences.
- Eating/meal plan approach. Method or strategy to individualize a desired eating pattern and provide practical tools for developing healthy eating patterns. Examples of dietary approaches include the plate method, carbohydrate choice, carbohydrate counting, and highly individualized behavioral approaches (85).

# Table 5.2—Macronutrient-specific nutrition recommendations

Recommendations5.24 Emphasize minimally processed, nutrient-dense, high-fiber sources of carbohydrate (at least 14 g fiber per 1,000 kcal). B5.25 Advise people with diabetes and those at risk to replace sugar-sweetened beverages (including fruit juices) with water or low-calorie or no-calorie beverages as much as possible to manage glycemia and reduce risk for cardiometabolic disease B and minimize consumption of foods with added sugar that have the capacity to displace healthier, more nutrient-dense food choices. A5.26 Regardless of diabetes classification, individuals treated with sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors should avoid a ketogenic eating pattern, be educated on the signs of ketoacidosis and methods of risk mitigation and be provided with appropriate tools for accurate ketone measurement (i.e., serum b-hydroxybutyrate), and be instructed to avoid fasting and maintain appropriate insulin therapy. E5.27 Provide education on the glycemic impact of carbohydrate, A fat, and protein B tailored to an individual’s needs, insulin plan, and preferences to optimize mealtime insulin dosing.5.28 When using fixed insulin doses, individuals should be provided with education about consistent patterns of carbohydrate intake with respect to time and amount while considering the insulin action time, as it can result in improved glycemia and reduce the risk for hypoglycemia. B5.29 People with diabetes and those at risk for diabetes are advised to incorporate more plant-based protein sources (e.g., nuts, seeds, and legumes) as part of an overall diverse eating pattern to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. B5.30 Counsel people with diabetes to consider an eating plan emphasizing elements of a Mediterranean eating pattern, which is rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and long-chain fatty acids such as fatty fish, nuts, and seeds, to reduce cardiovascular disease risk A and improve glucose metabolism. B5.31 Counsel people with diabetes and those at risk for diabetes to limit intake of foods high in saturated fat (e.g., red meat, full-fat dairy, butter, and coconut oil) to help reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

# Meal Planning

There is no ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein, or fat for people with diabetes. Therefore, macronutrient distribution should be based on an individualized assessment of current eating patterns, preferences, and metabolic goals. Members of the health care team should complement and reinforce MNT by providing evidence-based guidance that helps people with diabetes make healthy food choices that meet their individualized needs and improve overall health. Ultimately, ongoing diabetes and nutrition education paired with appropriate support to implement and sustain health behaviors are recommended (82).

Research confirms that a variety of eating patterns are acceptable for the management of diabetes (50,78,86,87). Evidence for eating patterns has been informed by RCTs, prospective cohort studies, systematic reviews, and network meta-analyses. Those most frequently recommended based on the evidence include Mediterranean, DASH, low-fat, carbohydrate-restricted, vegetarian, and vegan eating patterns. Until evidence around benefits of different eating patterns is strengthened, health care professionals should focus on the core dimensions common among healthful patterns: inclusion of nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and low-fat dairy products and minimizing consumption of red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, refined grains, and processed and ultraprocessed foods (88,89).

Referral to and ongoing support from an RDN is essential to assess the overall nutrition status of, and to work collaboratively with, the person with diabetes to create a personalized meal plan that coordinates and aligns with the overall lifestyle treatment plan, including physical activity and medication use. Using shared decision-making to collaboratively select a meal-planning method for how to execute the plan may be part of the nutrition care process.

One RCT found that two meal-planning approaches (diabetes plate method and carbohydrate counting) were effective in helping achieve improved A1C (95). The diabetes plate method (96) is a commonly used visual approach for providing basic meal planning guidance for individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This simple graphic (featuring a 9-in plate) shows how to portion foods: one-half of the plate for nonstarchy vegetables, one-quarter of the plate for protein, and one-quarter of the plate for carbohydrates. Carbohydrate counting is a more advanced skill that helps plan for and track how much carbohydrate is consumed at meals and snacks. Meal planning approaches should be customized to the individual, including their numeracy (95).

# Table 5.3—Nutrition behaviors to encourage

- Vegetables—especially nonstarchy vegetables that are dark green, red, and orange in color; fresh, frozen, or low-sodium canned are all acceptable vegetable options.
- Legumes—dried beans, peas, and lentils.
- Fruits—especially whole fruit—fresh, frozen, or canned in own juice (or no added sugar) are all acceptable fruit options.
- Whole-grain foods—where culturally appropriate, whole-grain versions of commonly consumed foods such as 100% whole-wheat breads or pastas, and brown rice. When not culturally appropriate, focus more on portion control.
- Foods with at least 3 g of fiber per serving, which generally indicates a food higher in fiber.
- Water should be the primary beverage of choice.
- For individuals who do not prefer plain water, no-calorie alternatives are the next best choice. Options include adding lemon, lime, or cucumber slices to water; sparkling no-calorie water or flavored no-calorie waters; no-calorie carbonated beverages, etc.
- Plant-based proteins can include legumes (e.g., soybeans, pinto beans, black beans, garbanzo beans, dried peas, and lentils), nuts, and seeds.
- Meats and poultry should be from fresh, frozen, or low-sodium canned and in lean forms (e.g., chicken breast and ground turkey).
- Heart-healthy wild-caught fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, and mackerel. Fresh, frozen, or low-sodium canned are all acceptable options.
- Use herbs (e.g., basil, fennel, mint, parsley, rosemary, and thyme) and spices (e.g., cinnamon, garam masala, ginger, pepper, and turmeric) to season foods instead of salt or salt-containing preparations.
- Incorporate onions, garlic, celery, carrots, and other vegetables as a base for preparing various homemade foods.
- Cook with vegetable oil (e.g., canola and olive) in place of fats high in saturated fat (e.g., butter, shortening, lard, and coconut oil).
- Meal prep by planning out meals for the week, grocery shopping with a list, and cooking on a day off so there are ready-to-eat and ready-to-reheat homemade meals waiting in the fridge or freezer.
- Include family or roommates in meal preparation; share the responsibilities of grocery shopping and cooking.

# Nutrition Therapy Goals for All People With Diabetes

1. To promote and support healthful eating patterns, emphasizing a variety of nutrient-dense foods in appropriate portion sizes, contributing to improved overall health, and to:
- achieve and maintain body weight goals
- attain individualized glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid goals
- delay or prevent the complications of diabetes
2. To address individual nutrition needs based on personal and cultural preferences, health literacy and numeracy, access to healthful foods, willingness and ability to make behavioral changes, and existing barriers to change.

# Carbohydrates

Studies examining the optimal amount of carbohydrate intake for people with diabetes are inconclusive, although monitoring carbohydrate intake is a key strategy in reaching glucose goals in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. For people with type 2 diabetes, low-carbohydrate and very-low-carbohydrate eating patterns have been found to reduce A1C and the need for glucose-lowering medications. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs found carbohydrate-restricted eating patterns, particularly those considered very low carbohydrate (<26% total energy), were effective in reducing A1C in the short term (<6 months), with less difference in eating patterns on cardiovascular disease (CVD).

---

# Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being

Health care professionals should maintain consistent medical oversight of individuals following very-low-carbohydrate eating plans and recognize that insulin and other diabetes medications may need to be adjusted to prevent hypoglycemia, and blood pressure will need to be monitored. In addition, very-low-carbohydrate eating plans are not currently recommended for individuals who are pregnant or lactating, children, people who have kidney disease, or people with or at risk for disordered eating.

Very-low-carbohydrate eating plans should also be used with caution in those taking sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors because of the potential risk of ketoacidosis. Numerous case reports have now been published illustrating that diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or euglycemic DKA can occur in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes using SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with very-low-carbohydrate or ketogenic eating patterns. Additionally, excessive alcohol intake should be avoided when taking SGLT2 inhibitors.

Regardless of the amount of carbohydrate in the meal plan, focus should be placed on high-quality, minimally processed, nutrient-dense carbohydrate sources high in fiber. Dietary fiber modulates gut microbiota composition and increases gut microbial diversity. Although there is still much to be elucidated about the gut microbiome and chronic disease, higher-fiber diets are advantageous. Both children and adults with diabetes are encouraged to minimize intake of refined carbohydrates with added sugars, fat, and sodium and instead focus on carbohydrates from vegetables, legumes, fruits, dairy (milk and yogurt) or fortified non-dairy alternatives, and whole grains.

People with diabetes and those at risk for diabetes are encouraged to consume a minimum of 14 g of fiber/1,000 kcal, with at least half of grain consumption being whole, intact grains, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025. Regular intake of sufficient dietary fiber is associated with lower all-cause mortality in people with diabetes, and prospective cohort studies have found dietary fiber intake is inversely associated with risk for type 2 diabetes.

The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and processed food products with large amounts of refined grains and added sugars is strongly discouraged, as it may displace healthier, more nutrient-dense food choices and increase inflammation.

# Protein

There is no evidence that adjusting the daily protein intake above or below the recommended amount for the general public (typically 0.8–1.5 g/kg body weight/day or 15–20% of total calories) will improve health, and research is inconclusive regarding the ideal amount of dietary protein to optimize either glycemic management or cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Therefore, protein intake goals should be individualized based on current eating patterns. Some research has found successful management of type 2 diabetes with meal plans including slightly higher levels of protein (20–30%), which may contribute to increased satiety.

Historically, low-protein eating plans were advised for individuals with diabetes.

related chronic kidney disease (CKD) (with albuminuria and/or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]); however, current evidence does not suggest that people with CKD need to restrict protein to less than the generally recommended protein intake (129). Reducing the amount of dietary protein below the recommended daily allowance of 0.8 g/kg is not recommended because it does not alter glycemic measures, cardiovascular risk measures, or the rate at which eGFR declines and may increase risk for malnutrition (129).

Growing evidence suggests higher plant protein intake and replacement of animal protein with plant protein is associated with lower risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. A meta-analysis of 13 RCTs showed that replacing animal proteins with plant proteins leads to small improvements in A1C and fasting glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes (130). A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 RCTs and 7 cohort studies concluded that there is limited-suggestive evidence to support replacing animal protein with plant-based protein based on a moderate degree of bias in cohort studies (131). However, a prospective observational study of more than 11,000 community-dwelling adults over 22 years of follow-up reported that those with higher intakes of plant foods and lower intakes of animal foods had lower diabetes risk (132). Plant proteins are lower in saturated fat, higher in fiber, and also support planetary health (133).

# Sodium

As for the general population, people with diabetes are advised to limit their sodium consumption to <2,300 mg/day (50,148). Sodium intake has been shown to mediate glucose metabolism in a number of studies and affect eGFR, so limiting sodium intake is a valuable strategy for people with diabetes with or without kidney disease (148,149). In their post hoc analysis of the DASH-sodium RCT, Morales-Alvarez et al. reported that participants randomized to the low-sodium DASH eating pattern (containing 1,150 mg sodium/day) had a change in eGFR of 3.10 mL/min/1.73 m² [50 mmol sodium/day] after 4 weeks compared with 3,450 mg sodium/day (150 mmol sodium/day) (150).

Limiting sodium intake is most easily achieved through reducing consumption of processed and ultraprocessed foods, which are major contributors of sodium intake. Encouraging people to avoid adding salt to foods and during cooking can also help. Sodium recommendations should consider palatability, availability, affordability, clinical appropriateness, and the difficulty of achieving low-sodium recommendations in a nutritionally adequate eating plan.

# Micronutrients and Other Supplements

Despite lack of evidence of benefit from dietary supplements, consumers continue to take them. Estimates show that up to 59% of people with diabetes in the U.S. use supplements (151). Without underlying deficiency, there is no benefit from herbal or other (i.e., vitamin or mineral) supplementation for people with diabetes (50,152).

Federal law in the U.S. broadly defines dietary supplements as products having one or more dietary ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, enzymes, tissues from organs or glands, or extracts of these (153). It should also be noted that dietary supplements are not regulated like other over-the-counter medications or prescription drugs in the U.S. (154).

views on dietary supplements (both posi- negative), this can contribute to consumer confusion (155). Consumers can also consult the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Dietary Supplement Ingredient Directory to locate information about ingredients used in dietary supplements and any action taken by the agency with regard to that ingredient (156). Routine antioxidant supplementation (such as vitamins E and C) is not recommended due to lack of evidence of efficacy and concern related to long-term safety. Based on the 2022 U.S. Preventative Services Task Force statement, the harms of b-carotene outweigh the benefits for the prevention of CVD or cancer. b-Carotene was associated with increased lung cancer and cardiovascular mortality risk (157).

# Alcohol

The long-term effects of alcohol consumption for people with diabetes are unknown. The World Health Organization declared that there is no safe amount of alcohol intake (167,168). Risks associated with alcohol consumption include hypoglycemia and/or delayed hypoglycemia (particularly for those using insulin or insulin secretagogue therapies), weight gain, and hyperglycemia (for those consuming excessive amounts) (50,169). People with diabetes should be educated about these risks and encouraged to monitor glucose frequently before and after drinking alcohol to minimize such risks. People with diabetes who consume alcohol can follow the same guidelines as those without diabetes consistent with Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025 (76), which does not promote alcohol consumption in people who do not currently drink. To reduce risk of alcohol-related harms, adults can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to #2 drinks a day for men or #1 drink a day for women (one drink is equal to a 12-oz beer, a 5-oz glass of wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits) (76).

Recent meta-analyses have reported the previously recognized J-shaped relationship between alcohol intake and health risks likely varies by sex, obesity status, genetics, and alcohol intake behaviors (170,171). A YMCA-based psychoeducational intervention tailored to those with chronic conditions, including 14- to 18-year-olds with type 1 diabetes, reported improvements in perceived risks of alcohol intake. Importantly, they also reported reduced alcohol consumption (172).

# Nonnutritive Sweeteners and Water

The FDA has approved many nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) (containing few or no calories; commonly referred to as artificial sweeteners) for consumption by the general public, including people with diabetes (50,173). However, the safety and role of NNS continue to be sources of concern and confusion for the public. For some people with diabetes who are accustomed to regularly consuming sugar-sweetened foods or beverages (e.g., regular soda pop, juice drinks, and other items sweetened with cane sugar or high-fructose corn syrup), NNS may be an acceptable substitute for nutritive sweeteners (those containing calories, such as sugar, honey, and agave syrup) when consumed in moderation (174). NNS do not appear to have a significant effect on glycemic management (175,176), and they can reduce overall calorie and carbohydrate intake (174) as long as individuals are not compensating with additional calories from other food sources (50,177). A recent meta-analysis and systematic review of RCTs found no evidence that NNS raise liver enzymes (178).

There is mixed evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses for NNS use with regard to weight management, with some finding benefit for weight loss (179–181) while other research suggests an association with weight gain (182,183). This may be explained by reverse causality and residual confounding variables (183). The addition of NNS to eating plans poses no benefit for weight loss or reduced weight gain without energy restriction (184).

In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis using low-calorie and no-calorie sweetened beverages as an intended substitute for sugar-sweetened beverages, a small improvement in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors was seen without evidence of harm and had a direction of benefit similar to that seen with water (185). While health care professionals should promote water as the healthiest beverage option, people with overweight or obesity and diabetes may also use a variety of no-calorie or low-calorie sweetened products so that they do not feel deprived (185).

Health care professionals should encourage reductions in foods and beverages with added sugars and promote reducing overall sugar intake and calories with or without the use of NNS. Assuring people with diabetes that NNS have undergone extensive safety evaluation by regulatory agencies and are continually monitored can allay unnecessary concern for harm. Health care professionals can regularly assess individual use of NNS based on the acceptable daily intake (amount of a substance considered safe to consume each day over a person’s life) and recommend moderation.

For special populations, including pregnant or lactating individuals, older adults, vegetarians, and people following very-low-calorie diets, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of herbal supplements and micronutrients, such as cinnamon (164), curcumin (e.g., turmeric), aloe vera, or chromium, to improve glycemia in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (50).

Metformin is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency per a report from the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), which suggests that periodic testing of vitamin B12 levels should be considered in people taking metformin, particularly in those with anemia or peripheral neuropathy (165) (see Section 9, “Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment”).

# Weight Management

Management and reduction of weight is important for people with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or prediabetes with overweight or obesity. To support weight loss and improve A1C, CVD risk factors, and well-being in adults with overweight or obesity and prediabetes or diabetes, MNT and DSMES services should include an individualized eating plan resulting in an energy deficit in combination with enhanced physical activity (50). Lifestyle intervention programs should be intensive and have frequent follow-up to achieve significant reductions in excess body weight and improve clinical indicators. Behavior modification goals should address physical activity, calorie restriction, healthy weight management strategies, and motivation. There is strong and consistent evidence that modest, sustained weight loss can delay the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes (82,186,187) (see Section 3, “Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities”) and is beneficial for type 2 diabetes management (see Section 8, “Obesity and Weight Management for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes”).

In prediabetes, the weight loss goal is at least 3–7% from baseline body weight, and higher for reducing risk of progression to type 2 diabetes. In conjunction with support for healthy lifestyle behaviors, medication-assisted weight loss can be considered for people at risk for type 2 diabetes when needed to achieve and sustain 7–10% weight loss (188,189) (see Section 8, “Obesity and Weight Management for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes”). People with prediabetes at a healthy weight should also be considered for behavioral interventions to help establish routine aerobic and resistance exercise (186, 190,191) as well as healthy eating patterns. Services delivered by health care professionals familiar with diabetes and its management, such as an RDN, have been found to be effective (81).

For many individuals with overweight or obesity alongside type 2 diabetes, at least 5% weight loss is needed to achieve beneficial outcomes in glycemic management, lipids, and blood pressure (192). The physiology of weight loss maintenance is complex and involves many hormonal, psychosocial, behavioral, and environmental factors. Following a weight loss of at least 8%, a subsequent “weight loss maintenance” intervention was reported to be beneficial.

However, any magnitude of weight loss is only moderately beneficial, as it helped sustain physical health improvements but not glucose metabolism improvements (210). However, in another RCT with long-term, real-world, clinic-based follow-up of 10 years, Tomah et al. reported lasting glycemic benefits in their cohort with an average weight loss of 7.7 ± 0.9 kg (6.9 ± 0.8%) maintained for 10 years (211).

Starting a conversation about weight management should be based on motivational interviewing techniques (212) beginning with first asking the individual if they want to discuss their weight. Health care professionals should never assume that a person with overweight or obesity wants to discuss their weight at a medical appointment, especially if the appointment is for a seemingly unrelated issue (e.g., back pain, which many people do not realize is often secondary to excess body weight).

In select individuals with type 2 diabetes, an overall healthy eating plan resulting in energy deficit and pharmacotherapy and/or metabolic surgery should be considered to help achieve weight loss and maintenance goals, lower A1C, and reduce CVD risk (188,201,202). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that when obesity pharmacotherapy is included in intervention efforts (alone or as part of a multipronged intervention), people with obesity can achieve a more significant weight loss of 2.94 kg (P < 0.0001) (203).

Along with routine medical management visits, people with diabetes and prediabetes should be screened during DSMES and MNT encounters for a history of dieting and past or current disordered eating behaviors. Characterizing an individual’s past efforts with weight loss and their body weight history can also be very useful. Nutrition therapy should be individualized to help address maladaptive eating behavior (e.g., purging) or compensatory changes in medical treatment plan (e.g., overtreatment of hypoglycemic episodes and reduction in medication dosing to reduce hunger) (50) (see DISORDERED EATING BEHAVIOR, below).

Disordered eating, eating disorders, and/or disrupted eating can increase challenges for weight and diabetes management. For example, caloric restriction may be essential for glycemic management and weight maintenance, but rigid meal plans and strict tracking of food intake and/or body weight may be contraindicated for individuals who are at increased risk of clinically significant maladaptive eating behaviors (213).

consumed earlier (224). Similarly, cir- factors are related to the nature of the diabetes medications (230). The safety of SGLT2 inhibitors was assessed in several studies during Ramadan fasting. These studies did not show significant change in kidney function, dehydration rates, or ketosis (238). Guidelines do not advise any change in SGLT2 inhibitor dose during fasting; however, they advise against initiating SGLT2 inhibitors close to the start of fasting days to avoid excessive thirst (230). Table 5.5 summarizes the effect of fasting on different treatment options and the possible change in doses or timing for people with diabetes.

# Religious Fasting Recommendations

5.32 Use the International Diabetes Federation along with Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance comprehensive prefasting risk assessment to generate a risk score for the safety of religious fasting. Provide fasting-focused education to minimize risks.

5.33 Assess and optimize treatment plan, dose, and timing for people with diabetes well in advance of religious fasting to reduce risk of hypoglycemia, dehydration, hyperglycemia, and/or ketoacidosis.

Technology could be an important tool to enhance safety during fasting. Several studies have investigated the use of monitoring technology during Ramadan fasting (e.g., flash glucose monitoring and real-time CGM [rtCGM]) and confirmed that these tools are able to support high-risk groups wishing to fast, especially if combined with Ramadan-focused education (238–240). Meanwhile, the use of insulin pumps has been associated with low rates of hypoglycemia during fasting in people with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes technologies should be considered as a useful adjunct to risk calculation and/or nutrition planning and education during religious fasting for people with diabetes (230).

Although intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating are specific dietary strategies for energy restriction, religious fasting has been practiced for thousands of years and is part of many faith-based traditions. Duration, frequency, and type of fast vary among different religions (226). For example, Jewish people abstain from any intake for 25 h during Yom Kippur (227,228). For Muslims, Ramadan fasting lasts for a full month, when abstinence from any food or drink is required from dawn to dusk (229). Individuals with diabetes who fast have an increased risk for hypoglycemia, dehydration, hyperglycemia, and ketoacidosis (230,231).

Prefasting risk assessment is essential to increase level of safety (230,231). Various risk factors need to be considered for every individual wishing to fast. Some of these factors are related to the type of fast, type of diabetes, and/or the individual. Indeed, health care professionals should inquire about any religious fasting for people with diabetes and provide education and support to accommodate their choice. The number of days of fasting is an important factor to consider. In Ramadan fasting, a person fasts from dawn to dusk for a lunar month (29–30 days). It is important for the health care professional to comprehensively assess these risk factors well in advance of fasting date, as some of them are modifiable. Some of these factors are related to the type of fast, type of diabetes, and/or the individual.

# Malnutrition

Malnutrition is defined by the World Health Organization as “deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients.” Malnutrition can occur in people of varying weight status, with the “double burden” of obesity and malnutrition being increasingly recognized among those with chronic conditions. Malnutrition is also more likely to develop in populations experiencing poverty and in older age-groups (241). Often, malnutrition and sarcopenia, which is a condition of loss in lean body mass combined with declined strength and functionality among older adults, codevelop (242).

A 2022 meta-analysis examined 45 studies including 12,237 adults and reported that 18% of people with type 2 diabetes had sarcopenia with A1C increasing the risk (odds ratio 1.16; 95% CI, 1.09–1.24) (243).

There is concern that GLP-1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP-1 RAs and metabolic surgery for weight loss, which are more common in some populations with...

diabetes, can increase the risk for malnutrition and sarcopenia (244,245). This is especially concerning among those with heart, kidney, or liver disease and obesity and among racial and ethnic minoritized communities (246,247). Health care professionals should encourage resistance training (248), sufficient protein intake, and screening for sarcopenia and malnutrition in people with diabetes who are experiencing significant or rapid weight loss because they could be at risk for malnutrition. While there is no single best method to screen for both malnutrition and sarcopenia, there are individual instruments available to screen for each respective condition including the Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ), the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), and others (249–251).

Advising a healthy, whole-foods–based eating pattern alongside regular strength training exercise to maintain lean body mass will be of paramount importance for these segments of the diabetes population (244) (see Section 8, "Obesity and Weight Management for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes").

Food Insecurity and Access
Food insecurity is a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food (252). In 2022, almost 13% of Americans were food insecure (252), and food insecurity affects 16% of adults with diabetes compared with 9% of adults without diabetes (253). There is a complex bidirectional association between food insecurity and co-occurring diabetes. Food security screening should happen at all levels of the health care system. Any member of the health care team can screen for food insecurity using the Hunger Vital Sign. Households are considered at risk if they answer either or both of the following statements as "often true" or "sometimes true" (compared with "never true") (254):

• "Within the past 12 months, we worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more."
• "Within the past 12 months, the food we bought just didn't last, and we didn't have money to get more."

If screening is positive for food insecurity, efforts should be made to refer to appropriate programs and resources. See

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY

Recommendations
5.34 Counsel youth with type 1 diabetes C or type 2 diabetes B to engage in 60 min/day or more of moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, with muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening activities at least 3 days/ week, and to limit the amount of time being spent sedentary, including recreational screen time. C
5.35 Counsel most adults with type 1 diabetes C and type 2 diabetes B to engage in 150 min or more of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, spread over at least 3 days/week, with no more than 2 consecutive days without activity. Shorter durations (minimum 75 min/ week) of vigorous-intensity or interval training may be sufficient for more physically fit individuals.
5.36 Counsel adults with type 1 diabetes C and type 2 diabetes B to engage in 2–3 sessions/week of resistance exercise on nonconsecutive days.
5.37 Recommend flexibility training and balance training 2–3 times/ week for older adults with diabetes. Yoga and tai chi may be included based on individual preferences to increase flexibility, muscular strength, and balance. C
5.38 For all people with diabetes, evaluate baseline physical activity and time spent in sedentary behavior (i.e., quiet sitting, lying, and leaning). For people who do not meet activity guidelines, encourage an increase in physical activities (e.g., walking, yoga, housework, gardening, swimming, and dancing) above baseline. B Counsel that prolonged sitting should be interrupted at least every 30 min for blood glucose benefits. C
5.39 Counsel adults and youth treated with weight management pharmacotherapy or metabolic surgery that meeting physical activity recommendations, and in particular muscle-strengthening exercises, may be beneficial for maintaining lean body mass. E

# Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being

Physical activity includes all movement that increases energy use, and it is an important part of the diabetes management plan. Exercise is a more specific form of physical activity that is structured and designed to improve physical fitness. Both physical activity and exercise are important. Exercise has been shown to improve blood glucose levels, reduce cardiovascular risk factors, contribute to weight loss, and improve well-being. Physical activity is important for the general population as well as people at risk for and with established diabetes. Exercise plays a specific role in glucose management and in the prevention of diabetes complications in those with type 2 diabetes. Many individuals with type 2 diabetes do not meet the recommended physical activity levels (150 min/week). Objective measurement by accelerometer in 871 individuals with type 2 diabetes showed that 44.2%, 42.6%, and 65.1% of White, African American, and Hispanic individuals, respectively, met the recommended physical activity threshold.

An RCT in 1,366 individuals with prediabetes combined a physical activity intervention with text messaging and telephone support, which showed improvement in daily step count at 12 months compared with the control group, but this was not sustained at 48 months. Another RCT, including 324 individuals with prediabetes, showed increased physical activity at 8 weeks with supportive text messages, but by 12 weeks there was no difference between groups. It is important for diabetes care management teams to understand the difficulty that many people have reaching recommended physical activity goals and to identify individualized approaches to improve physical activity and exercise goal achievement, which may need to change over time.

# Frequency and Type of Physical Activity

For all people with diabetes, baseline physical activity and time spent in sedentary behavior should be evaluated. People who do not meet activity guidelines should be encouraged to increase physical activity (e.g., walking, yoga, housework, gardening, swimming, and dancing) above baseline. Health care professionals should counsel people with diabetes to engage in aerobic and resistance exercise regularly. Aerobic activity bouts should last at least 10 min, with the goal of 30 min/day or more most days of the week for adults with type 2 diabetes. Daily exercise, or at least not allowing more than 2 days to elapse between exercise sessions, is recommended to decrease insulin resistance, regardless of diabetes type. A study in adults with type 1 diabetes found a dose-response inverse relationship between self-reported bouts of physical activity per week and A1C, BMI, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes-related complications such as hypoglycemia, DKA, retinopathy, and microalbuminuria, and higher physical activity reduces mortality risk in people with type 1 diabetes.

# Exercise and Youth

Youth with diabetes or prediabetes should be encouraged to engage in regular physical activity, including at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity every day and muscle- and bone-strengthening activities at least 3 days per week. Over time, activities should progress in intensity, frequency, and/or duration to at least 150 min/week of moderate-intensity exercise. Adults able to run at 6 mph (9.7 km/h) for at least 25 min can benefit sufficiently from shorter durations of vigorous-intensity activity or interval training (75 min/week). Many adults, including most with type 2 diabetes, should aim to increase their physical activity levels.

may be unable or unwilling to participate in activity and avoiding extended sedentary periods may help prevent type 2 diabetes for those at risk and may also aid in glycemic management for those with diabetes (289,290).

Adults with diabetes are encouraged to engage in 2–3 sessions/week of resistance exercise on nonconsecutive days (282). Although heavier resistance training with free weights or weight machines may improve glycemia and strength (283,284), resistance training of any intensity is recommended to improve strength, balance, and the ability to engage in activities of daily living throughout the life span. Health care professionals should support people with diabetes to set stepwise goals toward meeting the recommended exercise goals. As individuals intensify their exercise program, medical monitoring may be indicated to ensure safety and evaluate the effects on glucose management. (See PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND GLYCEMIC MANAGEMENT, below.)

# Physical Activity and Glycemic Management

The use of weight management pharmacotherapy has recently increased. Both weight management pharmacotherapy and metabolic surgery can lead to a decrease in body weight, which often induces fat mass loss as well as loss of lean body mass. This has raised concern about the loss of muscle mass leading over time to the development or worsening of frailty and sarcopenic obesity (285). One study demonstrated that after discontinuation of weight management pharmacotherapy with GLP-1 RAs in people with obesity but without diabetes, the combination of supervised exercise and GLP-1 RA therapy was more favorable in maintaining body weight and body composition compared with GLP-1 RA therapy alone. Data in people with diabetes and overweight or obesity are emerging. It is recommended that people with diabetes be encouraged to follow the physical activity recommendations, in particular muscle-strengthening activities, to reduce the loss of lean mass (285).

Evidence supports that all individuals, including those with diabetes, should be encouraged to reduce the amount of time spent being sedentary—waking behaviors with low energy expenditure (e.g., seated work at a computer and watching television)—by breaking up sedentary activity (at least every 30 min) by briefly standing, walking, or performing other light physical activities (286–288). Participating in leisure-time activity and avoiding extended sedentary periods may help prevent type 2 diabetes for those at risk and may also aid in glycemic management for those with diabetes (289,290).

# High-Intensity Interval Training

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) involves short bursts of aerobic training performed between 65% and 90% VO2peak (a measure of maximal aerobic capacity) or 75% and 95% heart rate peak for 10 s to 4 min with 12 s to 5 min of active or passive recovery. HIIT is a potentially time-efficient modality that can elicit significant physiologic and metabolic adaptations for individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (298,299). Higher intensities of aerobic training are generally considered superior to low-intensity training (300). HIIT reduces A1C and BMI and improves fitness levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Because HIIT can lead to transient increases in post-exercise hyperglycemia, individuals with type 1 diabetes may need to use bolus correction (301) and individuals with type 2 diabetes are encouraged to monitor blood glucose when starting HIIT (297). In type 1 diabetes, HIIT reduces A1C and insulin requirements and improves cardiometabolic risk profiles (299). Variability in glucose may occur with an increased risk in delayed hypoglycemia, so careful monitoring of glucose during and after HIIT is advised (299).

# Pre-exercise Evaluation

As discussed more fully in Section 10, “Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management,” the best protocol for assessing asymptomatic people with diabetes for coronary artery disease remains unclear. The ADA consensus report “Screening for Coronary Artery Disease in Patients With Diabetes” (302) concluded that routine testing is not recommended. However, health care professionals should perform a careful history, assess cardiovascular risk factors, and be aware of the atypical presentation of coronary artery disease, such as a recently reported or measured decrease in exercise tolerance. Certainly, those with high risk should be encouraged to start with short periods of low-intensity exercise and slowly increase the duration and intensity as tolerated. Health care professionals should assess for conditions that might contraindicate certain types of exercise or predispose to injury, such as uncontrolled hypertension, untreated proliferative retinopathy, autonomic neuropathy, orthostatic hypotension, peripheral neuropathy, balance impairment, and a history of foot ulcers or Charcot foot. Age and previous physical activity level should be considered when customizing the exercise plan.

# Importance of 24-Hour Physical Behaviors for Type 2 Diabetes

## SITTING/BREAKING UP PROLONGED SITTING
- Limit sitting. Breaking up prolonged sitting (at least every 30 min) with short regular bouts of slow walking or simple resistance exercises can improve glucose metabolism.

## SWEATING (MODERATE-TO-VIGOROUS ACTIVITY)
- Encourage ≥150 min/week of moderate-intensity physical activity (i.e., uses large muscle groups, rhythmic in nature) OR 75 min/week vigorous-intensity activity spread over ≥3 days/week, with no more than 2 consecutive days of inactivity. Supplement with two to three resistance, flexibility, and/or balance sessions.
- As little as 30 min/week of moderate-intensity physical activity improves metabolic profiles.

## STEPPING
- An increase of only 500 steps/day is associated with 29% decreased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality.
- A 5- to 6-min brisk-intensity walk per day equates to ~4 years' greater life expectancy.

## SLEEP
Aim for consistent, uninterrupted sleep, even on weekends.

- Quantity - Long (>8 h) and short (<6 h) sleep durations negatively impact A1C.
- Quality - Irregular sleep results in poorer glycemic levels, likely influenced by the increased prevalence of insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome in people with type 2 diabetes.
- Chronotype - Evening chronotypes (i.e., night owl: go to bed late and get up late) may be more susceptible to inactivity and poorer glycemic levels than morning chronotypes (i.e., early bird: go to bed early and get up early).

## PHYSICAL FUNCTION
Physical function/frailty/sarcopenia
- The frailty phenotype in type 2 diabetes is unique, often encompassing obesity alongside physical frailty, at an earlier age. The ability of people with type 2 diabetes to undertake simple functional exercises in middle-age is similar to that in those over a decade older.

## STRENGTHENING
Resistance exercise (i.e., any activity that uses the person's own body weight or works against a resistance) also improves insulin sensitivity and glucose levels; activities like tai chi and yoga also encompass elements of flexibility and balance.

to the individual's needs. Those with complications may need a more thorough evaluation prior to starting an exercise program (261).

### Hypoglycemia
For individuals taking insulin and/or insulin secretagogues, physical activity may cause hypoglycemia if the medication dose or carbohydrate consumption is not adjusted for the exercise session and post-bout effect on glucose. Individuals on these therapies may need to ingest

# Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

# Peripheral Neuropathy

Decreased pain sensation and a higher pain threshold in the extremities can result in an increased risk of skin breakdown, infection, and Charcot joint destruction with some forms of exercise. Therefore, a thorough assessment should be done to ensure that neuropathy does not alter kinesthetic or proprioceptive sensation during physical activity, particularly in those with more severe neuropathy. Moderate-intensity walking may not lead to an increased risk of foot ulcers or reulceration in those with peripheral neuropathy who use proper footwear. In addition, 150 min/week of moderate exercise improved outcomes in people with prediabetic neuropathy.

A causal link between cigarette smoking and diabetes has been established and reported on by the Surgeon General for over a decade. Results from epidemiologic, case-control, and cohort studies provide convincing evidence to support the causal link between cigarette smoking and multiple health risks that can have a profound effect on morbidity and mortality for people with diabetes.

# Autonomic Neuropathy

Autonomic neuropathy can increase the risk of exercise-induced injury or adverse events through decreased cardiac responsiveness to exercise, postural hypotension, impaired thermoregulation, impaired night vision due to impaired papillary reaction, and greater susceptibility to hypoglycemia. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular death and silent myocardial ischemia. Therefore, individuals with diabetic autonomic neuropathy should undergo cardiac investigation before beginning physical activity more intense than that to which they are accustomed.

# Chronic Kidney Disease

Physical activity can acutely increase urinary albumin excretion. However, there is no evidence that vigorous-intensity exercise accelerates the rate of progression of CKD, and there appears to be no need for specific exercise restrictions for people with CKD in general. Routine assessment of all types of tobacco use is essential to prevent tobacco product initiation and promote cessation. Evidence demonstrates significant benefits to quitting smoking for all people, resulting in a reduction and even reversal of adverse health effects in addition to an increase in life expectancy by as much as a decade.

# Retinopathy

If proliferative diabetic retinopathy or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy is present, then vigorous-intensity aerobic or resistance exercise may be contraindicated because of the risk of triggering vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment. Consultation with an ophthalmologist prior to engaging in an intense exercise plan may be appropriate.

# Recommendations

5.40 Advise all people with diabetes not to use cigarettes and other tobacco products or e-cigarettes.

5.41 Ask people with diabetes routinely about the use of cigarettes or other tobacco products.

5.42 Advise people with type 1 diabetes and those with other forms of diabetes at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis not to use recreational cannabis in any form.

# Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being

recommendations include both counseling and pharmacologic therapy to assist with smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults (320). A secondary data analysis of the Evaluating Adverse Events in a Global Smoking Cessation Study (EAGLES), a randomized, double-blind, triple-dummy, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial, found varenicline to be the most efficacious pharmacotherapy for people with diabetes when compared with placebo (321). These findings support the American Thoracic Society 2020 guideline recommending varenicline as a first-line pharmacotherapy for tobacco dependence (322). However, despite the effectiveness of pharmacologic therapy and counseling, more than two-thirds of people trying to quit do not receive treatment following evidence-based guidelines (317).

Weight gain after smoking cessation has been a concern related to diabetes management and risk for new onset of disease (323). While post-cessation weight gain is an identified issue, studies have found that an average weight gain of 3–5 kg does not necessarily persist long term nor diminish the substantial cardiovascular benefit realized from smoking cessation (316). These findings highlight the need for tobacco cessation treatment that addresses eating and physical activity needs. One study in people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who smoke found that smoking cessation was associated with amelioration of microalbuminuria and reduction in blood pressure after 1 year (324).

In recent years, there has been an increase in the use and availability of multiple noncigarette nicotine products. The evidence regarding the effect of these products on diabetes is not as clear as that for combustible cigarettes. It is known that smokeless tobacco products, such as dip and chew, pose an increased risk for CVD and oral cancer (325,326). Vaping with e-cigarettes and related devices has gained public awareness and popularity because of perceptions that e-cigarette use is less harmful than regular cigarette smoking (327). While combustible tobacco products are clearly the most harmful, electronic products should not be characterized as harmless, as health risks with use that affect the cardiovascular and respiratory systems have been identified (328,329).

Findings from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study suggest e-cigarettes may contribute to nicotine dependence, confirming there is no safe tobacco product (330,331). Individuals with diabetes should be advised to avoid vaping and using e-cigarettes, either as an approach to stop smoking combustible cigarettes or as a recreational drug. If people are using e-cigarettes to quit, they should be advised to avoid using both combustible and electronic cigarettes, and if using only e-cigarettes, they should be advised to have a plan to quit these also (319).

The increased prevalence in availability and use of tobacco and cannabis products and the effect on the health of people with diabetes highlights the need to ask about use of these products, educate individuals regarding the associated risks, and provide support for cessation.

# SUPPORTING POSITIVE HEALTH BEHAVIORS

Recommendation 5.43: Behavioral strategies should be used to support diabetes self-management and engagement in health behaviors (e.g., taking medications, using diabetes technologies, and engaging in physical activity and healthy eating) to promote optimal health-related quality of life and health outcomes.

Given associations with glycemic outcomes and risk for future complications (341,342), diabetes care professionals should support people with diabetes engaging in health-promoting behaviors (preventive, treatment, and maintenance), including blood glucose monitoring, taking insulin and medications, using diabetes technologies, engaging in physical activity, and making nutritional changes. Evidence-based behavioral strategies and multicomponent interventions, including motivational interviewing (343,344), activation (40), goal setting and action planning (344–346), problem-solving (7,345), tracking or self-monitoring health behaviors with or without feedback from a health care professional (344–346), and facilitating opportunities for social support (344–346), help people with diabetes and their caregivers or family members develop health behavior routines and overcome barriers to self-management.

Behavioral economics strategies (e.g., financial incentives and exposure to information about social norms) show mixed results in the promotion of health behaviors; however, they tend to enhance motivation and demonstrate short-term benefits for behavior change (347). Multicomponent behavior change interventions have the highest efficacy for behavioral and glycemic outcomes (346,348). For youth with diabetes, family-based behavioral intervention packages...

and interventions that address multiple outcomes. Cost analyses also have shown that behavioral health interventions are both effective and cost-effective approaches for the prevention of diabetes (372).

Importantly, adapting and tailoring behavior change strategies to the characteristics and needs of the individual and population are crucial (350,351). Health behavior change strategies can be delivered by behavioral health professionals, CDCES, other trained health care professionals (352,353), or qualified community health workers (345). Additionally, these approaches can be delivered via digital health tools (346,353,354). Finally, diabetes care professionals should be trained to use these methods effectively (e.g., motivational interviewing) (355).

# PSYCHOSOCIAL CARE

# Recommendations

5.44 Psychosocial care should be provided to all people with diabetes, with the goal of optimizing health-related quality of life and health outcomes. Such care should be integrated with routine medical care and delivered by trained health care professionals using a collaborative, person-centered, culturally informed approach.

5.45 Implement screening protocols for psychosocial concerns, including diabetes distress, depression, anxiety, fear of hypoglycemia, and disordered eating behaviors. Screen at least annually or when there is a change in disease, treatment, or life circumstances.

5.46 When indicated, refer to behavioral health professionals or other trained health care professionals, ideally those with experience in diabetes, for further assessment and treatment for symptoms of diabetes distress, depression, suicidality, anxiety, treatment-related fear of hypoglycemia, disordered eating, and/or cognitive capacities. Such specialized psychosocial care should use age-appropriate standardized and validated tools and treatment approaches.

5.47 Consider developmental factors and use age-appropriate validated tools for psychosocial screening in people with diabetes.

Psychosocial factors, including environmental, social, family, behavioral, and emotional factors, influence living with diabetes and achieving optimal health outcomes. People with diabetes and their families or caregivers face complex, multifaceted challenges integrating diabetes care into daily life (356). Clinically significant behavioral health diagnoses are considerably more prevalent in people with diabetes than in those without (357,358). Psychosocial well-being is a critical component of diabetes care and self-management. Psychological and social problems can interfere with a person’s (359–361) or family’s (361) ability to perform diabetes care tasks and negatively affect health status.

In addition to affecting a person’s ability to conduct self-management, behavioral health diagnoses are associated with reduced short-term glycemic stability and increased mortality risk (358,362). Therefore, psychological symptoms, both clinical and subclinical, must be addressed. Diabetes health care professionals should routinely monitor and screen for psychosocial concerns in a timely and efficient manner and refer to appropriate services (363,364).

Key opportunities for psychosocial screening occur at diabetes diagnosis, during regularly scheduled management visits, during hospitalizations, with new onset of complications, during significant transitions in care such as from pediatric to adult care teams (385), at the time of medical treatment changes, or when problems with achieving A1C goals, quality of life, or self-management are identified. Additionally, significant changes in life circumstances and SDOH are known to affect a person’s ability to self-manage their diabetes. Thus, screening for SDOH should also be incorporated into routine care (386).

In circumstances where individuals other than the person with diabetes are significantly involved in diabetes management (e.g., caregivers or family members), these issues should be monitored and treated by appropriate professionals (385,387).

Please refer to the ADA position statement “Psychosocial Care for People With Diabetes” (1), and guidance has been published about selection of screening tools, clinical thresholds, and frequency of screening (374,384).

# Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being

Standardized, validated, age-appropriate psychosocial assessment tools for psychosocial monitoring and screening can also be used (1). The ADA provides access to tools for screening specific psychosocial topics, such as diabetes distress, fear of hypoglycemia, and other relevant psychological symptoms at professional.diabetes.org/sites/default/files/media/ada_mental_health_toolkit_questionnaires.pdf. Additional information about developmentally specific psychosocial screening topics is available in Section 14, “Children and Adolescents,” and Section 13, “Older Adults.” Health care professionals may also use informal verbal inquires, for example, by asking whether there have been persistent changes in mood during the past 2 weeks or since the individual’s last appointment and whether the person can identify a triggering event or change in circumstances. Diabetes care professionals should also ask whether there are new or different barriers to treatment and self-management, such as feeling overwhelmed or stressed by having diabetes (see DIABETES DISTRESS, below), changes in finances, or competing medical demands (e.g., the diagnosis of a co-morbid condition).

# Psychological Assessment and Treatment

When psychosocial concerns are identified, referral to a qualified behavioral health professional, ideally one specializing in diabetes, should be made for comprehensive evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment (353,369,370). Indications for referral may include positive screening for diabetes distress, depression, anxiety, disordered eating, or cognitive dysfunction (see Table 5.6 for a complete list).

# Diabetes Distress Recommendation

5.48 Screen for diabetes distress at least annually in people with diabetes, caregivers, and family members, and repeat screening when treatment goals are not met, at transitional times, and/or in the presence of diabetes complications. Health care professionals can support behavioral health in people with diabetes at professional.diabetes.org/meetings/behavioral-health-toolkit.

# Table 5.6—Situations that warrant referral of a person with diabetes to a qualified behavioral health professional for evaluation and treatment

address diabetes distress and may con-
sider referral to a qualified behavioral
health professional, ideally one with ex-
perience in diabetes, for further assess-
ment and treatment if indicated. B

Diabetes distress is very common (361,
399,400). Distress is distinct from depres-
sion and anxiety and has unique relation-
ships with glycemic and other outcomes
(401,402) (Tables 5.7 and 5.8). Diabetes
distress refers to significant negative psy-
chological reactions related to emotional
burdens and worries specific to an indi-
vidual's experience in having to manage a
demanding chronic condition such as
diabetes (403). The constant behavioral
demands of diabetes self-management
(medication dosing, frequency, and ti-
tration as well as monitoring of glucose,
food intake, eating patterns, and physi-
cal activity) and the potential or actual
disease progression are directly associ-
ated with reports of diabetes distress
(404). Diabetes distress in people with
type 2 diabetes is common and persis-
tent, with prevalence rates over 60%
(404,405). Among people with type 1 dia-
betes, the prevalence of diabetes distress
is 22–42%, with a 9-month incidence of
54% (400,406). In the second Diabetes
Attitudes, Wishes, and Needs (DAWN2)
study, 45% of the participants reported sig-
nificant diabetes distress, but only 24% re-
ported that their health care teams asked
them how diabetes affected their lives
(361). Similar rates of diabetes distress
have been identified among adolescents
with type 1 diabetes (399) and in parents of
youth with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes distress
negatively affects medication-taking behav-
iors and is linked to higher A1C, lower self-
efficacy, and less optimal eating and exer-
cise behaviors (5,403,407). Diabetes dis-
tress is also associated with symptoms of
anxiety, depression, and reduced health-
related quality of life (408). The experience
of stigma related to living with diabetes may
contribute to increased diabetes distress
(409,410).
   Diabetes distress should be routinely
monitored (411) using diabetes-specific
validated measures (1), such as those
available through the ADA's website
(professional.diabetes.org/sites/default/
files/media/ada_mental_health_toolkit_
questionnaires.pdf). As there are vali-
dated diabetes distress measures for
people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes

at different life stages, it is important to select a tool that is appropriate for each person or population. If diabetes dis-tress is identified, it should be acknowl-edged and addressed (412). If indicated, the person should be referred for follow-up care (370). This may include specific DSMES to address areas of diabetes self-care caus-ing distress and affecting clinical manage-ment and/or behavioral intervention from a qualified behavioral health professional, ideally one with expertise in diabetes, or from another trained health care profes-sional (413).

Several educational and behavioral in-tervention strategies have demonstrated benefits for diabetes distress and, to a lesser degree, glycemic outcomes. These interventions include educational, psy-chological, and health behavior change approaches such as DSMES, cognitive be-havioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based therapies, motivational interviewing, and others (390,391,414,415). Interventions delivered via telephone, smartphone ap-plications, video visits, and/or self-help modalities can be effective in reducing di-abetes distress (397,416–418). DSMES has been shown to reduce diabetes distress (5,419) and may also benefit A1C when combined with peer support (420). It may be helpful to provide counseling regarding expected diabetes-related emotional dis-tress at diagnosis and when the disease state, treatment, or life context changes (413). Two multisite RCTs with adults with type 1 diabetes, elevated diabetes dis-tress, and elevated A1C demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in di-abetes distress and A1C through a com-bination of group-based intervention approaches including an educational dia-betes self-management program and a psychological intervention that included emotion-focused skills (417). In adults with type 2 diabetes in the Veterans Af-fairs system, an RCT demonstrated that integrating a single session of mindful-ness into DSMES, followed by a booster session and 24 weeks of mobile app–based home practice, significantly re-duced diabetes distress compared with a DSMES-only control group (421). An RCT of CBT demonstrated positive benefits for diabetes distress, A1C, and depres-sive symptoms for up to 1 year among adults with type 2 diabetes and elevated symptoms of distress or depression (422). An RCT among people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes found mindful self-compassion

# Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

Training increased self-compassion, reduced depression and diabetes distress, and improved A1C (423). An RCT of a resilience-focused cognitive behavioral and social problem-solving intervention compared with diabetes education in teens with type 1 diabetes showed that diabetes distress and depressive symptoms were significantly reduced for up to 3 years post-intervention, although neither A1C nor self-management behaviors improved over time (394). A meta-analysis of RCTs found that in type 1 diabetes, use of automated insulin delivery systems contributed to decreases in diabetes distress compared with usual care (i.e., sensor augmented pumps, multiple daily insulin injections, continuous glucose monitoring, and predictive low-glucose suspend) (424). These recent studies support that a combination of educational, behavioral, and psychological intervention approaches is needed to address distress, depression, and A1C.

There are few outcome data on long-term systematic treatment of diabetes distress integrated into routine care. As the burden of diabetes management can vary over time, diabetes distress may fluctuate and may need varying treatment approaches at different life stages and at different levels of diabetes progression.

# Anxiety

# Recommendations

1. Screen people with diabetes for anxiety symptoms. Health care professionals can discuss diabetes-related worries and should consider referral to a qualified behavioral health professional for further assessment and treatment if anxiety symptoms indicate interference with diabetes self-management behaviors or quality of life. B
2. Screen people with diabetes at risk for hypoglycemia or fear of hypoglycemia, especially if they have experienced severe and/or frequent hypoglycemic events. B

Anxiety symptoms are common in people with diabetes (425) (see Tables 5.7 and 5.8), and there appear to be higher rates of generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, specific phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder in people with diabetes than in those without diabetes. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System estimated the lifetime prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder to be 19.5% in people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes (426). A common diabetes-specific concern is fear related to hypoglycemia (427–429), which may explain avoidance of behaviors associated with lowering glucose, such as increasing insulin doses or frequency of monitoring. Factors related to greater fear of hypoglycemia in people with diabetes and family members include history of nocturnal hypoglycemia, presence of other psychological concerns, and sleep concerns (430). See Section 6, “Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia,” for more information about impaired awareness of hypoglycemia and related fear of hypoglycemia.

# Depression

# Recommendations

1. Conduct at least annual screening of depressive symptoms in all people with diabetes and more frequently among those with a history of depression. Use age-appropriate, validated depression screening measures, recognizing that further evaluation will be necessary for individuals who have a positive screen. B
2. Rescreen for depression at diagnosis of complications or when there are significant changes in medical status. B
3. Refer to qualified behavioral health professionals or other trained health care professionals with experience using evidence-based treatment approaches for depression in conjunction with collaborative care with the diabetes treatment team. A

History of depression, current depression, and antidepressant medication use are risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes, especially if the individual has other risk factors, such as obesity and family history of type 2 diabetes (439,440). Elevated depressive symptoms and depressive disorders are common among people with diabetes (357,429) (Tables 5.7 and 5.8), affecting approximately one in four people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (360), and among parents of youth with diabetes (441). Routine screening for depressive symptoms is indicated for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes mellitus. Regardless of diabetes type, women have significantly higher rates of depression than men (442). For individuals with type 2 diabetes, the experience of diabetes-related stigma is associated with increased depressive symptoms (410).

Routine monitoring with age-appropriate validated measures (1) can help to identify if referral is warranted (370). Multisite studies have demonstrated feasibility of implementing depressive symptom screening protocols in diabetes clinics and published practical guides for.

implementation (374,375). Person-centered integrated care approaches have been shown to improve both depression and glycemic outcomes (443). The behavioral health professional providing treatment for depression should be incorporated into or collaborate with the diabetes treatment team (443). Depressive symptoms may also be a manifestation of reduced quality of life secondary to diabetes burden (also see DIABETES DISTRESS, above) (411). When depressive symptoms are identified, it is important to query origins and exacerbating factors, both diabetes-specific ones and those due to other life circumstances (408,444).

Trials have shown consistent evidence of improvements in depressive symptoms and variable benefits for A1C when depression is treated simultaneously with diabetes (445), whether through pharmacologic treatment, group therapy, psychotherapy, parenting intervention, mindfulness-based approaches, or collaborative care (6,390,446–449). Psychological interventions addressing depressive symptoms have shown efficacy when delivered via digital technologies (447,450). A meta-analysis found that internet- and phone-delivered CBT and self-guided interventions improved depressive symptoms (451). For people with diabetes, an RCT comparing internet plus telephonic CBT to usual care found moderate to large improvements in depressive symptoms at 12 months (452). Lifestyle interventions (i.e., changing nutrition and/or physical activity) also demonstrate benefits for depressive symptoms and A1C (295) on their own and when combined with CBT (453–455). Finally, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that use of GLP-1 RAs led to significant improvement in depressive symptoms among adults with type 2 diabetes (456). It is important to note that the medical treatment plan should also be monitored in response to reduction in depressive symptoms.

# Disordered Eating Behavior

# Recommendations

5.54 Screen for disordered or disrupted eating using validated screening measures. In addition, a review of the medical treatment plan is recommended to identify potential treatment-related effects on hunger/caloric intake. B

Estimated prevalence of disordered eating behavior and diagnosable eating disorders in people with diabetes varies (457–459) (see Tables 5.7 and 5.8). People with type 1 diabetes have been found to be at greater risk for eating disorders than people without diabetes (460). Prevalence of intentional insulin omission to lose weight is 10% and more common among women than men with type 1 diabetes (460). In people with type 2 diabetes, bingeing (excessive food intake with an accompanying sense of loss of control) is most commonly reported. For people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, intentional omission is also frequently reported (461). People with diabetes and diagnosable eating disorders have high rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders (462). People with type 1 diabetes and eating disorders often have high rates of diabetes distress and fear of hypoglycemia (463). Diabetes care professionals should monitor for disordered eating behaviors using validated measures; diabetes-specific measures are recommended to assess presence of intentional insulin omission and were found in a meta-analysis to be more strongly associated with A1C (464).

When evaluating symptoms of disordered or disrupted eating (when the individual exhibits eating behaviors that appear maladaptive but are not volitional, such as bingeing caused by loss of satiety cues), etiology and motivation for the behavior should be evaluated by a qualified disordered eating professional (465). Inconsistent intervention findings point to the need for treatment of eating disorders and disordered eating behavior in the context of the condition and its treatment. Recent intervention efforts have focused on preventing disordered eating behaviors among individuals with type 1 diabetes and on supporting parents of youth with type 1 diabetes who are at risk for serious mental illness.

Monitoring of and assistance with diabetes self-management behaviors.

5.57 Monitor changes in body weight, glycemia, and lipids in adolescents and adults with diabetes who are prescribed second-generation antipsychotic medications; adjust the treatment plan accordingly, if needed.

Studies of individuals with serious mental illness, particularly schizophrenia and other thought disorders, show significantly increased rates of type 2 diabetes (474) (see Tables 5.7 and 5.8). People with schizophrenia and other thought disorders who are prescribed antipsychotic medications should be monitored for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes because of the known comorbidity. Changes in body weight, glycemia, and lipids should be monitored every 12–16 weeks, unless clinically indicated to be monitored sooner (475). Disordered thinking and judgment can make it difficult to engage in behaviors that reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as restrained eating for weight management. Further, people with serious mental illness and diabetes frequently experience moderate psychological distress, suggesting pervasive intrusion of behavioral health issues into daily functioning (476). Serious mental illness is often associated with the inability to evaluate and apply information to make judgments about treatment options. For a person with an established diagnosis of a mental illness affecting judgment, activities of daily living, and the ability to collaborate with care professionals, including a nonmedical caretaker, in treatment decision-making is beneficial. This caretaker can help improve the person’s ability to follow the agreed-upon treatment plan through both monitoring and caretaking functions (477).

# Cognitive Capacity and Impairment

Recommendations

5.58 Cognitive capacity should be monitored throughout the life span for all individuals with diabetes, particularly in those who have documented cognitive disabilities, those who experience severe hypoglycemia, very young children, and older adults.

5.59 If cognitive capacity changes or appears to be suboptimal for decision-making and/or behavioral self-management, referral for a formal assessment should be considered.

Cognitive capacity is generally defined as attention, memory, logic and reasoning, and auditory and visual processing, all of which are involved in diabetes self-management behavior (480) (see Tables 5.7 and 5.8). Long-term diabetes (type 1 or type 2) has been associated with cognitive decline (481,482). In people with type 1 diabetes, the following factors have been linked with cognitive impairment: diabetes-specific factors (e.g., younger age at diagnosis, longer disease duration, more time in glycemic extremes, recurrent DKA, higher A1C, and presence of microvascular complications), other medical factors (e.g., dyslipidemia, intestinal flora, and poorer sleep quality), and sociodemographic factors (e.g., female sex and lower educational level) (483). Diagnosis of dementia is more prevalent among people with diabetes, both type 1 and type 2 (484). Executive functioning is an aspect of cognitive capacity that has particular relevance to diabetes management. Declines in cognitive capacity have been shown to affect executive function and information processing speed; they are not consistent between people, and evidence is lacking regarding a known course of decline (485).

Episodes of severe hypoglycemia are independently associated with cognitive decline as well as the more immediate symptoms of mental confusion (489). Early-onset type 1 diabetes is associated with potential long-term deficits in intellectual abilities, especially in the context of repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia (490), and is correlated with higher A1C and sensor glucose values (491) (See Section 14, “Children and Adolescents,” for information on early-onset diabetes and cognitive abilities and the effects of severe hypoglycemia on children’s cognitive and academic performance). Thus, for myriad reasons, cognitive capacity should be assessed during routine care to ascertain the person’s ability to maintain and adjust self-management behaviors.

such as dosing of medications, remediation quality (501,502), and sleep problems are also common in parents of youth with diabetes, especially soon after diagnosis (503,504). Disrupted sleep and sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (505), insomnia, and sleep disturbances (506), are common among people with diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, estimates of poor sleep range from 30% to 50% (507), and estimates of moderate to severe OSA are >50% (505). In type 2 diabetes, 24–86% of people are estimated to have OSA (508), 39% to have insomnia, and 8–45% to have restless leg syndrome (i.e., an uncontrollable urge to move legs) (509). Further, people with type 2 diabetes and restless leg syndrome are more likely to experience microvascular and macrovascular complications (510) as well as depression (511). Additionally, people with diabetes who perform shift work increase their risk for circadian rhythm disorders, which are associated with higher A1C (512), neuropathy (513), and decreased psychological well-being (513). Importantly, the risk of cognitive decline can be reduced through improved A1C (495). Further, glucose-lowering treatments may decrease the risk of cognitive decline. A systematic review and network meta-analysis showed that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs had a decreased risk for cognitive impairment, whereas sulfonylureas had the highest increased risk for cognitive impairment (496). Additionally, exercise may be a potential nonpharmacologic treatment pathway for cognitive impairment in older adults with type 2 diabetes (497).

# Sleep Health

# Recommendations

5.60 Consider screening for sleep health in people with diabetes, including symptoms of sleep disorders, disruptions to sleep due to diabetes symptoms or management needs, and worries about sleep. Refer to sleep medicine specialists and/or qualified behavioral health professionals as indicated.

5.61 Counsel people with diabetes to practice sleep-promoting routines and habits.

The associations between sleep problems and diabetes are complex: sleep disorders are a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes (498,499) and possibly gestational diabetes mellitus (500). People with diabetes across the life span often experience sleep disruptions and reduced sleep.

Sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia activate the sympathetic nervous system, contributing to hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, increased circulating free fatty acids, impaired microcirculation, oxidative stress, and psychological stress (515). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 RCTs with 964 total participants found that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) significantly reduced A1C by 0.24% (95% CI 0.43 to 0.06%, P = 0.001) (516). Similarly, a randomized proof-of-concept study with 30 adults with OSA and obesity compared CPAP therapy, GLP-1 RA–mediated weight loss, and both in combination for 24 weeks (517). Findings showed that CPAP alone and in combination reduced apnea-hypopnea severity more than GLP-1 RA–mediated weight loss alone. CPAP therapy also improved vascular inflammation and reduced unstable plaque volume, suggesting potential benefits for early CVD.

Two phase 3, double-blind RCTs with 469 adults with OSA and obesity showed that a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA significantly reduced.

sleep difficulties, referral to sleep specialists to address the medical and behavioral aspects of sleep is recommended, ideally in collaboration with the diabetes care team (Fig. 5.2).
